<p>Journalist Yashar Ali shared a statement from the group in an X post on Thursday ‚Äî just ahead of the DNC&#8217;s final evening, when Harris is expected to formally accept the Democratic Party&#8217;s 2024 presidential nomination.</p>

<p>&#8220;The family of the Israeli Hostage that was on the stage tonight, has shown more empathy towards Palestinian Americans and Palestinians, than our candidate or the DNC has. This is a terrible message to send to Democrats. Palestinians have the right to speak about Palestine. We pray that the DNC and VP Harris team makes the right decision before this convention is over. For the sake of each of us,&#8221; it concluded.</p>
<p>Wednesday evening opened with an emotional speech from Jon Polin and Rachel Goldberg, the parents of Israeli-American Hamas hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin, which led to chants of &#8220;Bring them home!&#8221; from the crowd.</p>

<p>Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote for <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/dnc-2024-palestine-israel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vanity Fair</a> that he believed the Democratic Party was missing the mark by not including a Palestinian speaker ‚Äî particularly because the DNC&#8217;s host city of Chicago is home to &#8220;more Palestinian-Americans than anywhere else in the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you would not know this looking at that stage,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;Despite the appeals of Palestinian American delegates and activists, no Palestinian American is scheduled to address the convention from the main stage. I suspect this is because of what such a speaker might feel compelled to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went on to cite casualty numbers pushed by the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry, claiming ‚Äî as Hamas has ‚Äî that Israel had indiscriminately slaughtered civilians and even children.</p>
<p>Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who spoke on the DNC stage herself earlier in the week, voiced her agreement that the party should include a Palestinian speaker: &#8220;Just as we must honor the humanity of hostages, so too must we center the humanity of the 40,000 Palestinians killed under Israeli bombardment. To deny that story is to participate in the dehumanization of Palestinians. The @DNC must change course and affirm our shared humanity.&#8221;</p>

<p>Palestinian Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) also chastised the DNC directly, claiming that allowing the parents of Israeli hostages to speak without giving equal time to Palestinians sent a message that Israeli lives were worth more.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking from the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday night, CNN anchor Dana Bash argued that the Democratic Party was appealing to men who were not ‚Äútestosterone-laden,‚Äù contending that Democrats like Tim Walz and Doug Emhoff can speak to those kinds of men.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The subject was broached in a three-way conversation between Bash and fellow anchors Abby Phillip and Jake Tapper.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúThe gender gap, in American politics, has been trending very strongly, for years,‚Äù Tapper contended. ‚ÄúBut this year, at least according to polls, it is so strong. The women &#8212; the women vote is overwhelmingly for Harris. The male vote overwhelmingly for Trump, though not as much.‚Äù</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amiracist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amiracist.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1724211156439000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2-L2DitSaIUj5wz8v0bgxx"><b>Tickets for ‚ÄúAm I Racist?‚Äù are on sale NOW! Buy here for a theater near you.</b></a></p>
<p>That launched Bash into her analysis of the Democrats‚Äô appeal to men who were not ‚Äútestosterone-laden‚Äù:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Yes. And there&#8217;s the gender gap. Then there&#8217;s the idea that for the last month, the Democratic Party has been rallying around a woman, at the top of the ticket, which is, the only other time they did it, which is in 2016. And it has been noteworthy to see how they are learning about what to do, and how to confront Donald Trump, as the opponent to a woman, 2016 and now, very different campaigns, very different female candidates.</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>But they are doing so in trying to put forward male figures, Tim Walz being one of them, Doug Emhoff, last night, who can speak to men, out there, who might not be the sort of testosterone-laden gun-toting kind of guy, who wants to listen to Hulk Hogan, and the kind of players that came out at the RNC, or might want to listen to that.</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>But also, in addition, understand that it&#8217;s OK, in 2024, to be a man, comfortable in his own skin, who supports a woman. And that&#8217;s something that they really are trying to work on, with male voters, beyond the base.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúWe were talking about this earlier,‚Äù Tapper stated. ‚ÄúThe different definitions of masculinity in 2024. And what we saw at the Trump convention, which was, as you know, somebody, I forget &#8212; forget exactly who said it, testosterone with Kid Rock, and the ultimate fighting champion guy and Hulk Hogan who&#8211;Remember, Hulk Hogan actually ripped off his shirt and he had another shirt underneath, which, I think is not exactly what the rip off the shirt thing is supposed to be.‚Äù</p>

      <description>Movie and TV show review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes has introduced a new audience-generated ‚ÄúPopcornmeter‚Äù rating that is only available for verified movie ticket purchasers.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/topic/movies"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Movie and TV show review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aggregator </span><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/topic/rotten-tomatoes"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rotten Tomatoes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has introduced a new audience-generated ‚ÄúPopcornmeter‚Äù rating that is only available for verified movie ticket purchasers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/new-rotten-tomatoes-score-badge-verified-hot-1235974680/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hollywood Reporter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a movie must receive a verified audience score of 90% or higher on the Popcornmeter to receive an official Verified Hot badge. The movie must have</span> a minimum of Verified Ratings for films in wide release and a minimum of 250 Verified Ratings for limited releases to qualify for the <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/about">Popcornmeter</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amiracist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amiracist.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1724211156439000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2-L2DitSaIUj5wz8v0bgxx"><b>Tickets for ‚ÄúAm I Racist?‚Äù are on sale NOW! Buy here for a theater near you.</b></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Movies that earn a score of at least 3.5 out of 5 stars in 60% of their audience reviews will receive a &#8220;full popcorn bucket&#8221;, while films with scores under that will receive a &#8220;tipped over popcorn bucket.&#8221;¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Verified ratings must come from users who have purchased movie tickets through Fandango, the sister site of Rotten Tomatoes.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newer releases that earned the &#8220;Verified Hot&#8221; badge so far include ‚ÄúBad Boys: Ride or Die,‚Äù ‚ÄúFly Me to the Moon,‚Äù ‚ÄúDeadpool &amp; Wolverine,‚Äù ‚ÄúTwisters,‚Äù ‚ÄúIt Ends With Us,‚Äù and others. Older films, including ‚ÄúTop Gun: Maverick,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Color Purple,‚Äù ‚ÄúParasite,‚Äù ‚ÄúOppenheimer,‚Äù ‚ÄúDune: Part Two,‚Äù and others are having the badge retroactively </span><a href="https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/verified-hot-honoring-the-films-with-the-highest-verified-audience-scores/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">applied</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another change on the site is updating the minimum number of critic reviews that must be submitted before the Tomatometer score is calculated. If a movie debuts at a film festival or is projected to earn $60 million or less at the box office, it needs 10 reviews to get a score. Any film projected to earn between $60 million and $120 million needs 20 reviews, and any projected to receive over $120 million needs 40 reviews, per THR.</span></p>
<p><b><a href="http://www.amiracist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.amiracist.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1724211156439000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2xQ8bdTcpfdrPBAzczIuck">WATCH THE TRAILER FOR ‚ÄòAM I RACIST?‚Äô ‚Äî A MATT WALSH COMEDY ON DEI</a></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This change is being seen in the industry as an attempt to combat the effects of ‚Äúreview bombing,‚Äù or the practice of users intentionally driving down the score of an entertainment project.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúOn Rotten Tomatoes, fans love to consult our verified audience score, in addition to the Tomatometer critics‚Äô score, when discovering new movies and deciding what they want to watch next,‚Äù Amanda Norvell, senior VP of direct-to-consumer services at Fandango, said of the site update.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúWith the addition of Verified Hot, we are excited to celebrate and shine a spotlight on the theatrical films that fans have unanimously embraced and have taken the time to share their incredible moviegoing experience with other fans,‚Äù she added.</span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he &#8220;would be honored&#8221; to have the endorsement of the &#8220;respected&#8221; Robert F. Kennedy Jr. after reports swirled that the Democrat-turned-independent presidential candidate is <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/rfk-jr-dropping-out-of-race-will-address-nation-while-in-same-city-as-trump-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planning</a> to throw his support behind Trump in an address later this week.</p>
<p>ABC News reported on Wednesday that Kennedy is expected to end his independent bid for president in a speech on Friday, in which he will also endorse the Republican nominee. Kennedy is slated to speak in Phoenix on Friday as Trump holds an event in Glendale, Arizona, which is just outside of Phoenix. Trump called in to &#8220;Fox &amp; Friends&#8221; Thursday morning to discuss multiple issues and was asked by host Ainsley Earhardt if he knew any more about Kennedy&#8217;s reported plans.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I&#8217;ve known him for a long time. As you know, he is a little different kind of a guy. Very smart guy and a very good person. If he endorsed me, I would be honored by it,&#8221; Trump said. &#8220;He really has his heart in the right place. He is a respected person. Women love some of his policies and I guess some people don‚Äôt like some of his policies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trump added that he believes Democrats forced Kennedy out of the party&#8217;s primary because &#8220;there was a good chance&#8221; that he would have beaten President Joe Biden in the primary.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amiracist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amiracist.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1724211156439000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2-L2DitSaIUj5wz8v0bgxx"><b>Tickets for ‚ÄúAm I Racist?‚Äù are on sale NOW! Buy here for a theater near you.</b></a></p>
<p>&#8220;I don‚Äôt know what he is right now, but he was a Democrat ‚Äî they treated him very badly. He goes around saying he would have beaten Biden in the primary. I think there was a good chance.&#8221;</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br />
While Kennedy has stayed quiet on the reports of his potential Trump endorsement, his running mate Nicole Shanahan <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/rfk-jrs-running-mate-we-may-join-forces-with-donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> earlier this week that their campaign was considering &#8220;two options.&#8221; The first &#8220;is staying in [the race], forming that new party, but we run the risk of a Kamala Karris and Walz presidency because we draw votes from Trump,‚Äù Shanahan said. ‚ÄúOr we walk away right now and join forces with Donald Trump and you know, we walk away from that and we explain to our base why we‚Äôre making this decision.‚Äù</p>
<p>Kennedy has dropped to 4.5% in the <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-harris-vs-kennedy-vs-stein-vs-west" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RealClearPolitics</a> national polling average in recent weeks after hovering around 10% for much of the year. After Harris became the Democratic nominee, polls have suggested that Kennedy would take more votes away from Trump than he would from the Democratic ticket. The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/08/rfk-jr-third-party-effect-are-now-hurting-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cited</a> six recent polls that all showed Harris performing better if Kennedy remained in the race.</p>
<p>The former Democratic candidate blasted the DNC after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and Vice President Kamala Harris was named the nominee without receiving a primary vote.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father and my uncle were members of a Democratic Party that was at the forefront of making sure that every American could vote for the candidate they wanted to. Today‚Äôs Democratic Party is doing the opposite,&#8221; Kennedy <a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1826074927197466856" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> on Tuesday as the Democratic National Convention continued in Chicago.</p>
<p>He also slammed Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Democratic Governor Tim Walz, <a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1825950913107775707" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posting</a> on X, &#8220;The Democratic Party positions itself as the party of liberty. Kamala Harris says that Americans should make personal decisions without the &#8216;government telling them what to do.&#8217; Tim Walz‚Äôs Golden Rule is &#8216;Mind your own damn business.&#8217; In view of the censorship, surveillance, vaccine mandates, and the confederacy of fixers openly working to prevent me from getting on ballots, this is like the arsonist telling us he‚Äôs a firefighter.&#8221;</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday night, after Pennsylvania Democrat Governor Josh Shapiro spoke at the Democratic National Convention, former President Donald Trump took aim at not only Shapiro but also Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, correctly pointing out the Democrats‚Äô abandonment of the Jewish state and his own unmatched record of support for Israel.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Shapiro, who is Jewish, was passed over for Harris‚Äô vice-presidential slot in a move that was widely considered to be Harris‚Äô fear of the anti-Semites and anti-Israel members of the Democratic Party. In his speech, he never mentioned Israel once or anything regarding foreign policy, instead claiming Harris and the Democrats are the party of ‚Äúfreedom.‚Äù</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amiracist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amiracist.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1724211156439000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2-L2DitSaIUj5wz8v0bgxx"><b>Tickets for ‚ÄúAm I Racist?‚Äù are on sale NOW!

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Trump wasted no time in targeting Shapiro and Harris for their lack of support for the Jewish state, writing on <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113003710039708925">Truth Social</a>, ‚ÄúThe highly overrated Jewish Governor of the Great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, made a really bad and poorly delivered speech talking about freedom and fighting for Comrade Kamala Harris for President, yet she hates Israel and will do nothing but make its journey through the complexities of survival as difficult as possible, hoping in the end that it will fail. Judge only by her actions!‚Äù</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Trump‚Äôs point regarding Harris making Israel‚Äôs journey for survival as difficult as possible has been borne out by her administration‚Äôs insistence on slow-walking military aid to Israel, and their pressure on Israel to make concessions to the terrorist group Hamas. Harris‚Äô own remarks after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/cotton-blasts-dangerous-liberal-harris-over-comments-after-netanyahu-meeting">considered</a> to be <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/trump-calls-harris-disrespectful-to-israel-after-netanyahu-meeting">undermining</a> the Jewish state.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúYet Shapiro, for strictly political reasons, refused to acknowledge that I am the best friend that Israel, and the Jewish people, ever had,‚Äù Trump continued. ‚ÄúI have done more for Israel than any President, and frankly, I have done more for Israel than any person, and it‚Äôs not even close. Shapiro has done nothing for Israel, and never will. Comrade Kamala Harris, the Radical Left Marxist who stole the nomination from Crooked Joe, will do even less. Israel is in BIG trouble!‚Äù</p>
<p><b><a href="http://www.amiracist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.amiracist.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1724211156439000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2xQ8bdTcpfdrPBAzczIuck">WATCH THE TRAILER FOR ‚ÄòAM I RACIST?‚Äô ‚Äî A MATT WALSH COMEDY ON DEI</a></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Trump‚Äôs claim of his unmatched support for Israel is accurate. In 1995, Congress passed the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995, which recognized Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Israel and called for Jerusalem to remain an undivided city. It called for setting aside funds to relocate the American Embassy to Jerusalem by 1999. The law allowed the President to invoke a six-month waiver of the application of the law and reissue the waiver every six months on &#8220;national security&#8221; grounds. The waiver was repeatedly renewed by Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">But Trump made the move happen in 2018. On February 23, 2018, Trump announced that the US Embassy in Israel would reopen in Jerusalem on May 14, 2018, to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the Israeli Declaration of Independence. In addition, Trump recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, an area that was vital to Israel‚Äôs national security interests, as its enemies would fire down at Israelis in every previous war.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 20-year-old man who attempted to assassinate former President Donald Trump on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania, used encrypted messaging accounts on platforms in multiple foreign countries, according to Rep. Mike Waltz (R-FL).</p>
<p>Waltz, who is on the Congressional task force investigating the assassination attempt, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/trump-shooter-multiple-encrypted-accounts-overseas-germany-rep-waltz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> reporters in Chicago on Wednesday that it has not &#8220;learned that much&#8221; about Thomas Matthew Crooks&#8217; encrypted messaging accounts, but he did reveal that they discovered the accounts were based on platforms in Belgium, Germany, and New Zealand, which the congressman described as strange, The New York Post <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/21/us-news/trump-shooter-thomas-crooks-had-encrypted-messaging-accounts-in-belgium-germany-new-zealand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>. Encrypted messaging apps allow for text messages to be sent through an encrypted code that can only be deciphered by the recipient&#8217;s device.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why does a 19-year-old kid who is a health care aide need encrypted platforms not even based in the United States, but based abroad, where most terrorist organizations know it is harder for our law enforcement to get into? That‚Äôs a question I‚Äôve had since day one,&#8221; Waltz told reporters at the Trump Hotel in downtown Chicago.</p>
<p>Waltz, a retired Green Beret, then ripped the FBI and Secret Service for not releasing more information from the investigations into the attempted assassination.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amiracist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amiracist.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1724211156439000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2-L2DitSaIUj5wz8v0bgxx"><b>Tickets for ‚ÄúAm I Racist?‚Äù are on sale NOW!

<p>&#8220;They need to be releasing information as they come across it because this wasn‚Äôt an isolated incident,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The threats are continually Iran‚Äôs threats.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before the assassination attempt, U.S. authorities were informed by a source that there was an Iranian plot to kill Trump, CNN <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/16/politics/iran-plot-assassinate-trump-secret-service/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>. The Biden administration reportedly told the Trump campaign and Secret Service of the alleged plot, but the troubling intelligence info raised new concerns about the security breakdown at Trump&#8217;s rally. Iran &#8220;strongly&#8221; rejected it had any role in the Trump assassination attempt, adding that it &#8220;is determined to pursue legal action against Trump for his direct role in the crime of assassinating Martyr General Qassem Soleimani.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trump responded to Iran&#8217;s alleged plot to assassinate him, <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112848319395019188" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writing</a> on Truth Social, &#8220;If they do &#8216;assassinate President Trump,&#8217; which is always a possibility, I hope that America obliterates Iran, wipes it off the face of the Earth ‚Äî If that does not happen, American Leaders will be considered &#8216;gutless&#8217; cowards!&#8221;</p>

<p>Late last month, the House <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/house-reveals-members-of-task-force-to-investigate-trump-assassination-attempt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> its 13-member task force appointed to investigate the Trump assassination attempt. It is made up of seven Republicans and six Democrats. The House and Senate have also grilled leaders of the Secret Service and the FBI over security failures at the July 13 Trump rally.</p>
<p>Crooks accessed a roof just 130 yards from where Trump stood on stage. The would-be assassin fired eight shots, one of which struck Trump in his right ear. Another bullet hit and killed Trump supporter and firefighter Corey Comperatore. Two other rallygoers, David Dutch and James Copenhaver, were also struck by the gunfire and injured.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Target CEO Brian Cornell slammed claims by Democrat presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday that retailers were hurting consumers by engaging in price gouging.</p>
<p>Harris said last week that her plan to combat inflation that skyrocketed during the Biden-Harris administration was to implement price controls, which most economists oppose.</p>
<p>Cornell was asked during an interview on CNBC: &#8220;Have you boosted any of your profits from gouging on prices? And how prevalent and pervasive do you think that was in terms of causing the recent 40-year highs in inflation?&#8221;</p>
<p>Cornell responded by noting that the retail giant has reduced prices on roughly 5,000 items.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amiracist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amiracist.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1724211156439000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2-L2DitSaIUj5wz8v0bgxx"><b>Tickets for ‚ÄúAm I Racist?‚Äù are on sale NOW! Buy here for a theater near you.</b></a></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll put my retail hat on for a second,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You two talk to industry leaders in every different sector. Is there a more competitive space than retail?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re celebrating this morning, the fact that we delivered a margin rate of over 6%,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You talk to other CEOs who are delivering up income of 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;So we&#8217;re in a penny business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a penny business, and it&#8217;s a very competitive space, and we provide the value consumers are looking for,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>He also said that raising corporate taxes, which Harris supports, would hurt businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the taxes were reduced, we put our capital to work,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Since 2017 when the corporate taxes were reduced, we spent close to $50 billion of capital building new stores across the country, remodeling over 1,000 stores.&#8221;</p>
<p><b><a href="http://www.amiracist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.amiracist.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1724211156439000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2xQ8bdTcpfdrPBAzczIuck">WATCH THE TRAILER FOR ‚ÄòAM I RACIST?‚Äô ‚Äî A MATT WALSH COMEDY ON DEI</a></b></p>
<p>&#8220;We put the business dollars back into our business,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;It&#8217;s helped us grow since 2017 our top line almost $40 billion, and I think it&#8217;s the way America should work.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a lengthy post on Wednesday on </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C-8sKGYymIC/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=c9a7024e-a077-4158-8be8-3ab3e2d75cb2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the </span><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/taylor-swift-shows-in-austria-canceled-following-arrest-of-two-suspects-in-concert-attack-terror-plot"><span style="font-weight: 400;">34-year-old singer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said she had officially wrapped the European leg of ‚ÄúThe Eras Tour‚Äù as she praised the ‚Äúpassionate crowds‚Äù who came out and thanked her crew and fellow performers for making it possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúWalking onstage in London was a rollercoaster of emotions,‚Äù Swift wrote. ‚ÄúHaving our Vienna shows canceled was devastating. The reason for the cancellations filled me with a new sense of fear, and a tremendous amount of guilt because so many people had planned on coming to those shows.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúBut I was also so grateful to the authorities because thanks to them, we were grieving concerts and not lives,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúI was heartened by the love and unity I saw in the fans who banded together. I decided that all of my energy had to go toward helping to protect the nearly half a million people I had coming to see the shows in London.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúMy team and I worked hand in hand with stadium staff and British authorities every day in pursuit of that goal, and I want to thank them for everything they did for us,‚Äù Swift continued. ‚ÄúLet me be very clear: I am not going to speak about something publicly if I think doing so might provoke those who would want to harm the fans who come to my shows.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ‚ÄúShake It Off‚Äù hitmaker said by remaining silent until the European part of the tour wrapped up, she was ‚Äúactually showing restraint‚Äù and that it was right to wait to express herself.</span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former President <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/topic/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> promised at a rally in <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/topic/north-carolina" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North Carolina</a> on Wednesday to remove all the military commanders who have pushed ‚Äúinsulting‚Äù woke policies under the Biden-Harris administration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump made the comments during a rally at the North Carolina Aviation Museum and Hall of Fame in Asheboro, North Carolina. The rally was his first outdoor event since he was nearly assassinated last month when he was struck by a bullet while speaking at a campaign event in Butler, Pennsylvania.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking from behind bulletproof glass, Trump </span><a href="https://truthsocial.com/@TeamTrump/posts/113001588844403689" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that he would rid the military of wokeness if elected president, warning that electing Vice President Kamala Harris would continue the radicalization of the military.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Under ‚ÄòComrade Kamala,‚Äô our military has been abused for radical social experiments,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOn day one, I will get Critical Race Theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our U.S. Armed Forces. We‚Äôre taking it out. Our warriors should be focused on defeating America‚Äôs enemies, not figuring out their genders.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúMarxist ideologies have no place in combat,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe want them to know their gender when they go in. You have no idea the disruption that that has caused and the fake news refuses to report it.‚Äù</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previous <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/woke-leadership-is-gutting-u-s-military-through-dei-trans-policies-gop-report-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> from House Republicans have indicated how the U.S. Military has been weakened through the adoption of DEI policies and LGBT initiatives. For example, the U.S. Special Forces put out a report claiming that ‚Äúdiversity and inclusion are operational imperatives.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump said those policies would stop if he was elected in November.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúIf you want to have a sex change or a social justice seminar, then you can do it somewhere else, but you‚Äôre not going to do it in the Army, Navy, Coast Guard, Space Force, or the United States Marines,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe military brass that lead these absurd and insulting initiatives will likewise be removed. They will no longer be in command. They‚Äôre going to be gone, gone so fast.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The former president also said that he would demand the resignations on inauguration day of those involved in Biden‚Äôs disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan that led to billions of dollars in American military equipment being left with the Taliban and the death of 13 American troops in a terror attack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúThe voters will hold Kamala and Joe accountable this November,‚Äù he <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@TeamTrump/posts/113001577865082065" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>. ‚ÄúI will ask for the resignations of every single senior military official who touched the Afghanistan disaster. I want their resignations immediately.‚Äù</span></p>
<p>North Carolina, which Trump won in both 2016 and 2020, is seen as one of the key battleground states for 2024.</p>

      <description>Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo was called out during a live interview on Wednesday for falsely suggesting that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump made up numbers that were released earlier in the day by President Joe Biden&amp;#8217;s Bureau of Labor Statistics.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Commerce Secretary <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/topic/gina-raimondo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gina Raimondo</a> was called out during a live interview on Wednesday for falsely suggesting that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump made up numbers that were released earlier in the day by President Joe Biden&#8217;s Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ces/notices/2024/2024-preliminary-benchmark-revision.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that job growth throughout the 12 months ending in March would be revised downward by 818,000 jobs, a hefty drop that is roughly equivalent to 0.5% of total jobs. The downward revision was the largest in decades.</p>
<p>When asked during an ABC News interview whether the damaging jobs report could hurt Democrat presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris&#8217; campaign, Raimondo responded: &#8220;No, when I hear that, first of all, I don&#8217;t believe it because I have never heard Donald Trump saying anything truthful.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ABC News host quickly interjected: &#8220;It is, though, from the Bureau of Labor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t, I&#8217;m not familiar with that,&#8221; Raimondo claimed.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, Raimondo <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/08/21/gina-raimondo-dnc-economy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the thing she hates the most about Republicans was &#8220;they just peddle bulls***.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trump slammed the revised jobs report in a social media post earlier in the day, calling it a &#8220;MASSIVE SCANDAL!&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amiracist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amiracist.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1723831707612000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0pyrv88A5nsmWM2F2Wr9As"><b>Tickets for ‚ÄúAm I Racist?‚Äù are on sale NOW! Buy here for a theater near you.</b></a></p>
<p>&#8220;The Harris-Biden Administration has been caught fraudulently manipulating Job Statistics to hide the true extent of the Economic Ruin they have inflicted upon America,&#8221; Trump said. &#8220;New Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the Administration PADDED THE NUMBERS with an extra 818,000 Jobs that DO NOT EXIST, AND NEVER DID.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The real Numbers are much worse than that and, if Comrade Kamala gets another four years, millions more Jobs will VANISH overnight, and Inflation will completely destroy our Country,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;YOUR LIFE SAVINGS WILL BE WIPED OUT. With a TRUMP VICTORY, we will once again have the Greatest Economy in History.&#8221;</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rep. Mike Waltz (R-FL) got into a heated debate with CNN&#8217;s Brianna Keilar on Wednesday over Governor <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/topic/tim-walz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tim Walz</a> (D-MN) and his repeated efforts to embellish or even outright lie about his time serving in the Army National Guard.</p>
<p>Walz is scheduled to make a speech at the Democratic National Convention officially accepting the party&#8217;s nomination for the vice presidency, and Waltz was one of a number of Republicans who signed an official letter condemning the Minnesota Democrat&#8217;s exaggerations, implications, and lies regarding his time in service.</p>
<p>Keilar asked Waltz about the letter during a Wednesday segment, repeatedly accusing Waltz and other Republicans of attacking Walz&#8217;s service ‚Äî Waltz was quick to explain that it was not the service itself that anyone was attacking, but rather the lies about it.</p>
<p><strong>WATCH:</strong></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We‚Äôre NOT attacking Tim Walz‚Äôs service. We just want to know, if he is ‚Äúdamn proud‚Äù of it, why has he continued to misrepresent and lie about it his entire career?</p>
<p>The veterans community is waiting for his answer. <a href="https://t.co/rh6XQSscUE">pic.twitter.com/rh6XQSscUE</a></p>
<p>‚Äî Rep. Mike Waltz (@michaelgwaltz) <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelgwaltz/status/1826358154025996589?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Keilar began by saying that the letter was an attack on Walz&#8217;s military service, adding, &#8220;Why are you doing that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I disagree. I‚Äôm sorry, Brianna ‚Äì&#8221; Waltz pushed back.</p>
<p>&#8220;You were attacking ‚Äî well, I read the letter ‚Äî so then, OK, you are attacking his representation of ‚Äì&#8221; Keilar tried again.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amiracist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amiracist.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1723831707612000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0pyrv88A5nsmWM2F2Wr9As"><b>Tickets for ‚ÄúAm I Racist?‚Äù are on sale NOW! Buy here for a theater near you.</b></a></p>
<p>&#8220;I am attacking the lies about his service,&#8221; Waltz clarified.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me say what‚Äôs in the letter. The comment about the gun, the weapon of war that he obviously didn‚Äôt carry into war, and he should answer a question about that,&#8221; Keilar said. &#8220;And how he represented his retired rank, which was obviously different than what he was promoted to and what he retained after retirement. But also that issue of whether he abandoned his unit for a deployment to Iraq and did not go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Keilar then played a clip of one veteran who had served with Walz ‚Äî who did not necessarily share his political views ‚Äî but defended his military record. She did not play clips of others who have spoken out after serving with Walz ‚Äî including the Command Sergeant Major who ultimately replaced him on the deployment in question ‚Äî who have repeatedly stated that he left his men high and dry.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean, that man hates Tim Walz‚Äôs politics, despises them, is not going to vote for him. But he served with him and he knows his service,&#8221; Keilar pressed. &#8220;So why are you and other Republicans doing this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I want to be clear and correct your characterization,&#8221; Waltz said again. &#8220;I‚Äôm not attacking his service &#8230; He said he‚Äôs proud of that service. If he‚Äôs so damn proud about it, why does he have to continue to embellish it and to lie about it? Because the facts are clear. He was promoted to sergeant major, but he didn‚Äôt do the things necessary to retire at that rank and was demoted. And yet there is ample ‚Äî hundreds, hundreds of incidences where he is describing himself as a retired command sergeant major. That may sound like semantics to some, but to veterans, and particularly enlisted veterans, that matters. It‚Äôs a lie, it‚Äôs a misrepresentation and exaggeration, and he should account for that. I can tell you as ‚Äî&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It‚Äôs not stolen ‚Äî it‚Äôs not stolen valor,&#8221; Keilar insisted. &#8220;I just want to be clear, and the letter, I‚Äôm reading this, I‚Äôm reading this, Mike and quote &#8216;abandoning the men and women under your leadership, just as they were getting ready to deploy, was certainly not honorable either.&#8217; That is an attack on his service.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is attack on the decision to not go to combat with his unit as a leader,&#8221; Waltz rebutted.</p>
<p>The conversation continued until Waltz finally said, &#8220;Brianna, you know, rather than defending these decisions, I wish you would interview him and ask him those questions, or that he would at least sit down and answer for these inconsistencies. The other thing we say in the letter is repeatedly he was described in front of him, introduced at events, described in articles, as a combat veteran and he did nothing to correct it. And he still today is doing nothing to correct it. So he clearly implied and allow others to describe himself as a combat veteran, and he clearly exaggerated his service, which he shouldn‚Äôt have done for political gain. That is unacceptable to the veterans community. It‚Äôs an insult to those who did what it took to be a command sergeant major and retire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That goes to both his judgment and Harris‚Äô judgment when he‚Äôs going to be a heartbeat away as commander-in-chief and likely the only person with any military experience in the room,&#8221; Waltz added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, look, he has some questions to answer for ‚Äî&#8221; Keilar agreed, adding, &#8220;I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs worth burning down 24 years of service.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish he would sit down instead of me or JD Vance and answer those questions. The American people deserve it, the veterans community certainly deserve it,&#8221; Waltz shot back.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like all elections, the 2024 presidential election will bring a new wave of Americans to the polls. This year, many Gen-Z members will cast their vote for the first time. As someone who spent 40 years working with America‚Äôs youth as a coach and educator, I am proud that our country encourages our young people to make their voices heard.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This presidential election happens to be an incredibly consequential one too. It‚Äôs a choice between two distinct visions for America. I believe President Trump‚Äôs vision for our country will bring young voters into the Republican Party like we‚Äôve never seen before. And there is good reason to believe this will happen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let‚Äôs look at the two different visions for America. On one hand, you have President Trump‚Äôs vision of a free, prosperous, and safe America where young people can work hard to achieve the American dream. According to President Trump‚Äôs vision, merit, content of character, and love of country will bring you success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, there is the Democratic Party which is the political wing of the ‚ÄúWoke HR Complex‚Äù that is ruling our country today. This Woke HR Complex includes corporate America, the mainstream media, Hollywood, and the higher education system. Together, this regime determines winners and losers in our country based on identity, like racial and sexual identity, and judges you based on your adherence to Wokism. It‚Äôs like a country-wide HR department that polices people who dare challenge the prevailing liberal narrative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main rule of the Woke HR Complex is simple: in order to succeed, make sure you adhere 100% to the standards of political correctness and identity politics. Be sure to never offend the liberal sensibilities of the regime. If you ask questions, you will be labeled an ‚Äúextremist,‚Äù ‚Äúconspiracy theorist,‚Äù or worse. If you transgress the Complex, you will be disciplined, like an HR department, for attempting to think freely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gone are the days of Democrats being the party of ‚Äúfree thinkers,‚Äù anti-establishment figures, and working-class populists. Democrats like RFK Jr. or Tulsi Gabbard who bravely questioned the liberal-elite narrative were outlawed and ostracized by the Party.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is my belief that young Americans will reject this vision for our country. Young people don‚Äôt want to be told that they must think a certain way or that they are a prisoner to their own circumstances. They don‚Äôt want to be reduced to their skin color, sexual preferences, or by how well they adhere to liberal cultural guidelines. Young people inherently like to challenge the status quo‚Äîand the Democratic Party doesn‚Äôt permit its members to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, young people want a country that gives them an opportunity stand on their own two feet. They want to think for themselves and not be canceled for questioning the Complex‚Äôs equation for success. They‚Äôre growing tired of the same old liberal talking points parroted by the media, universities, and corporate America‚Äîthey want to break free.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs probably why politically incorrect or ‚Äúedgy‚Äù entertainers are making a splash with young people. Take the massive popularity of comedians like Shane Gillis and Joe Rogan. Online streamers are also gaining huge followings for speaking their mind. Trump‚Äôs campaign understands this phenomenon and has brilliantly set-up interviews between President Trump and prominent influencers like Jake Paul and Adin Ross. Young people are drawn to these figures because they question the Complex‚Äôs narrative‚Äîand they see that President Trump is doing the same. If polls are to be believed, perhaps this is why Trump is making inroads with young voters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my own experience as a coach, I‚Äôve worked with thousands of young people across the country. I had kids of all races, ethnicities, and socio-economic backgrounds on my teams. I‚Äôve coached both men and women‚Äôs sports. What was common with all these young adults is that they believed in working hard and earning success on their own merit. They loved to ask questions to figure out how to be the best. They needed a leader to guide them and encourage them to ask questions, not police their thoughts and actions. Similarly, President Trump will provide our Nation‚Äôs young people with the environment and the tools needed to prosper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Republican pundits will say that it‚Äôs President Trump‚Äôs policies that are winning young people over. I agree that his excellent policies play a big part. But many Establishment Republicans don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs so obvious to young voters: President Trump is a breath of fresh air in the stuffy HR department age we live in.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an exaggeration to say that when young Americans mark an ‚ÄúX‚Äù next to Donald J. Trump‚Äôs name on Nov. 5, they are taking a revolutionary stance against the toxic groupthink culture represented by Kamala Harris and the Democrat Party.

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong? A doctor please. It is very hot here, I notice,&#8221; Trump <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybb4tP1Fc74" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> as people in the crowd shouted &#8220;Medic!&#8221;</p>

<p>After a few moments, Trump stepped down from his podium and walked toward the stands on his left, where he chatted with the smiling woman, who had revived and held a bottle of water.</p>
<p>The Republican nominee had to abandon the protection of the bulletproof glass he was speaking behind in order to approach the woman.</p>
<p>Trump hugged her before returning to his podium.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you very much. You know, they come two days, three days early, and it&#8217;s a lot of stress. We lose them,&#8221; Trump said when he returned to the podium on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The temperature was over 75 degrees in Asheboro on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the President Trump the media will never show you,&#8221; the Trump campaign&#8217;s War Room account <a href="https://x.com/TrumpWarRoom/status/1826333615501787340?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=ncl_amplify&amp;utm_campaign=240821-top_must_watch_moments_from_asheboro_north_carolina&amp;utm_content=ncl-wqXyrTSJAY&amp;_nlid=wqXyrTSJAY&amp;_nhids=lzYLF94L" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> on X along with a video of the moment.</p>
<p>Wednesday&#8217;s rally was Trump&#8217;s first one outdoors since a gunman made an assassination attempt on his life last month.</p>
<p>On July 13, a young male gunman was able to scale a nearby roof during Trump&#8217;s rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, and took a shot, grazing the former president&#8217;s ear and nearly killing him. After the assassination attempt, the Trump campaign had opted to hold rallies indoors until Wednesday&#8217;s rally.</p>
<p>Trump is currently in a dead heat race with Vice President Kamala Harris for the presidency. Nationally, Harris leads the former president by one and a half percentage points, <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-harris" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according</a> to the RealClearPolitics average of polls.</p>
<p>During Wednesday&#8217;s rally, Trump also hammered several issues, particularly foreign threats.</p>
<p>&#8220;Peace in Europe has been shattered by the largest European land war since the fall of Nazi Germany,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Trump also threw barbs at his opponent, noting that during the 2020 presidential race, Harris dropped out before the Iowa Caucuses.</p>
<p>&#8220;She ran against Biden. There were 22 people running. She was the first to leave. She quit,&#8221; Trump said. &#8220;She never made it to the first state in the primary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have stupid people running our government, and she&#8217;ll be worse than Biden because he wasn&#8217;t really a believer, but she&#8217;s a radical Left believer,&#8221; he said. &#8220;She ruined San Francisco. She ruined California, and if she gets in, our country doesn&#8217;t have a chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This calamity is on Comrade Kamala Harris&#8217; shoulders,&#8221; he said.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday night of the Democratic National Convention featured hatred of actual wealth creation ‚Äî people who got super rich off the taxpayer dime and then made their subsequent fame and fortune.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Democratic Party has an addiction to taxpayer nepo-babies. Their belief is that no one in the private sector actually creates wealth or jobs; all innovation is a lie. According to them, the best people on earth are people who live off the taxpayer dime their entire political lives. And then, later, they get a little rich, exceptionally rich, or buy three houses (like the Obamas), off of their fame and fortune from having lived off the taxpayer dime their entire lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But these are supposedly the most praiseworthy people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Democrats, actual wealth creation and innovation are terrible. Thus, America needs an over-class of special people who&#8217;ve been living off the taxpayer dime since their youth and who&#8217;ve never created a job or business ‚Äî never innovated a single damn thing. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people need to make all the rules of the road for everyone else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was the DNC on Tuesday night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They have never innovated. They&#8217;ve never built a business. They&#8217;ve never done a damned thing outside of taking taxpayer money to boss people around. That is all they do all day long. That is true at every level of the top echelon of the Democratic Party.</span></p>
<h4><strong><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/episode/ep-2031-member-exclusive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WATCH: The Ben Shapiro Show</a></strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barack Obama has never held a real job, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ever</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He was a community organizer his entire life, and then he went directly into taxpayer-funded politics. None of those are real jobs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michelle Obama worked at a private law firm for five minutes, and then got a cushy gig at the University of Chicago because her husband was in politics. Now, she gallivants around, being famous, wealthy, and well-loved because her husband was president of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chuck Schumer has been in politics since 1862. He has never held a job in the private sphere. Nancy Pelosi&#8217;s husband was very rich, but she has never run a business. She has been in politics since before Socrates was killed.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bernie Sanders is a career leech on the taxpayer. A man so useless, he was once thrown out of a commune for failing to do work. A man who was a deadbeat dad while living on a commune in Vermont and preaching about socialism while making trash educational home videos.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">None of these people have ever created a damned thing. Ever. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these people are loaded. They didn&#8217;t get loaded by creating things. They got loaded by redistributing money from other people who earned it. They got loaded by seizing control of the levers of distribution. That is how they got rich.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then they turn around and blame the people who actually create the wealth. That&#8217;s part of what underlies their hatred for Donald Trump.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They hate that Trump was a businessman for decades before he became president of the United States. All of these people became rich </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">after</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> being politicians. Trump became rich </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">before</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> being a politician.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Left is constantly harping on the idea that if you grew up rich, then there is something innately evil about you; that if you received the benefit of growing up middle-class or above in the United States, you are effectively an affirmative action child.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was the case that Michelle Obama tried to make on Tuesday night, </span><a href="https://abc7ny.com/post/michelle-obama-dnc-speech-read-full-text-former-ladys-address-night-2-democratic-convention/15211430/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">saying:</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†</span></p>
<blockquote><p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of us will never be afforded the grace of failing forward. We will never benefit from the affirmative action of generational wealth. If we bankrupt a business or choke in a crisis, we don&#8217;t get a second, third, or fourth chance. If things don&#8217;t go our way, we don&#8217;t have the luxury of whining or cheating others to get further ahead, no. We don&#8217;t get to change the rules so we always win. If we see a mountain in front of us, we don&#8217;t expect there to be an escalator waiting to take us to the top.</span></em></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There you go: the Iron Law of Woke Projection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúWe don&#8217;t get a second, third, or fourth chance‚Äù to fail up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s Kamala Harris&#8217; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">entire career</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Her entire career has been failing up. She was a crappy D.A., and she was made into a crappy attorney general by the skin of her teeth in a super-blue state. She was made into a crappy senator, and then she failed. And she was made a crappy vice president. And then she also failed. And she&#8217;s now made into a crappy presidential nominee and presumably will be a crappy president. She has done </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">nothing but fail up</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the idea that the Obamas have never been given a second, third, fourth chance? They get endless chances because they&#8217;re in politics. There‚Äôs no return on investment demanded for what they do; nobody is expecting them to meet a bottom line. They&#8217;ve never gone bankrupt because there&#8217;s one group of people who can&#8217;t go bankrupt: politicians. It‚Äôs not possible because they are living off the taxpayer dime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The government cannot go bankrupt. It just prints additional dollars. If your policies fail, you can always confiscate dollars from people who actually made those dollars. That&#8217;s the beauty of being a politician. That&#8217;s the beauty of being reliant on the taxpayer. You can never go bankrupt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúAffirmative action of generational wealth‚Äù? Do you know how many people have blown generational wealth? It happens all the time. The one parental scheme that can </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">never be blown</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the one where the government is your daddy or mommy. They&#8217;ll just keep cutting those checks forever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This idea that you never get a second, third, fourth chance from the federal government under a Democratic scheme is a lie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s so sickening when Michelle Obama says they won&#8217;t rig the rules. The Dems just ousted the presidential nominee, and they‚Äôre trying to rig all the rules of the Supreme Court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My favorite part was when Michelle Obama said that her parents were suspicious of folks who ‚Äútook more than they needed.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She owns three houses. Three. Is that more than she needs? Given her contribution to the world at large, it seems the answer would be a resounding </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">yes</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hypocrisy is astounding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, the anti-Semitism at the DNC was so bad that Jewish events had to be held at undisclosed locations under heavy security. Pro-Hamas demonstrators burned the American flag.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the RNC, the crowd chanted ‚Äúbring them home‚Äù about the hostages taken by Hamas; they were chanting in solidarity for Israel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Josh Kraushaar asked the Democratic governor of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, if he agreed with President Biden that the anti-Israel protesters ‚Äúhave a point.‚Äù Shapiro </span><a href="https://x.com/JoshKraushaar/status/1825912986495598937"><span style="font-weight: 400;">responded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look, I haven&#8217;t heard specifically what they&#8217;ve said. I&#8217;m not trying to duck your question. I&#8217;ll address it. I think protesters absolutely have a right to have their voices be heard. Whatever the rules of the road are. The mayor of Chicago, I assume he sets that. They gotta follow the rules, but their voices should be heard and they should be encouraged to exercise their first Amendment rights. Whether I agree with them or not is beside the point.</span></i></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, that actually </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the point. But he‚Äôs a coward because the Jews at the top level of the Democratic Party don&#8217;t care about Israel. They don&#8217;t care about Judaism. They care much more about fealty to their party. If those were white supremacists outside applying their First Amendment rights, would Shapiro have said something about the cause for which they were burning the American flag?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday night, the Democrats tried to trot out two of the least credible sources on fighting anti-Semitism in America. Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader who has presided over the pro-Iran tilt of the Democratic Party, the complete consolidation of the anti-Semitic squad within the Democratic hierarchy, and made excuses for every anti-Semite under the sun.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also heard from Doug Emhoff, who&#8217;s as Jewish as a ham sandwich. Emhoff talking about Judaism is like me talking about traditional Catholicism. He has no relationship with Judaism. He doesn&#8217;t know what the hell he&#8217;s talking about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For years we&#8217;ve played videos of Emhoff trying to pretend he understands what a Jewish holiday is. He has no clue. He told the story of Purim, and his story of Purim was completely wrong. Then, he told the story of Hanukkah, and it was completely wrong. His daughter fundraises for the UNRWA, the Hamas front-group, and his wife presides over an anti-Semitic Democratic Party.</span></p>
<h4><strong><a href="https://www.amiracist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tickets for ‚ÄúAm I Racist?‚Äù are on sale NOW! Buy here for a theater near you.</a></strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chuck Schumer talked about how he&#8217;s the highest ranking Jewish official in American history. He ripped Trump as a guy who peddles anti-Semitic stereotypes.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What a trash person Schumer is. Trump is the most pro-Israel, pro-Jewish president in American history. And Schumer, a person who covers for the Squad, says </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">he</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is standing up against anti-Semitism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You‚Äôve got to be kidding me. Any Jew who falls for this crap is a moron.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emhoff is a scumbag who banged the nanny, who had an abortion. That&#8217;s why he got divorced in his first marriage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&#8217;t pretend you&#8217;re speaking for Jews and Judaism when you say stupid crap like, ‚ÄúKamala has connected me more deeply to my faith, even though it&#8217;s not the same as hers. She comes to synagogue with me for high holiday services and I go to church with her for Easter.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can tell how Jewish you are when you say that your Judaism is reconfirmed by going to church on Easter Sunday with your wife and your pro-Hamas daughter. That&#8217;s not Torah Judaism or Judaism in any way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, Emhoff bragged, Kamala does ‚Äúmake a mean brisket.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You sad sacks can&#8217;t condemn anti-Semitism within your own party, but you‚Äôre speaking for Jews because Kamala Harris makes a brisket and Doug Emhoff goes to church on Easter Sunday?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúKamala has fought against anti-Semitism and all forms of hate her whole career,‚Äù he boasted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hell she has. She won&#8217;t even fight against Hamas, which wants to eliminate the state of Israel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hypocrisy of the Democratic Party is repulsive in every way.</span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/topic/jennifer-lopez"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jennifer Lopez</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is ‚Äúdevastated‚Äù over her failed marriage to actor </span><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/jennifer-lopez-and-ben-afflecks-68m-mansion-hits-market-amid-divorce-rumors"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ben Affleck</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after she filed for divorce on Tuesday following two years of marriage, a source shared with </span><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/jennifer-lopez-devastated-about-ben-affleck-divorce-gave-her-all-make-work-source"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox News</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the second anniversary of the 55-year-old singer‚Äôs southern wedding ceremony in Georgia, Lopez put to bed rumors about the Hollywood superstar‚Äôs relationship troubles when she filed for divorce in Los Angeles County Superior Court without an attorney, the outlet reported.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A source has since told the outlet that the actress feels she ‚Äúgave it her all to make this work‚Äù with Affleck and is ‚Äúdevastated‚Äù she couldn‚Äôt make their marriage work after they rekindled their romance in the summer of 2021, after previously calling off their first engagement in 2004.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another source said the ‚ÄúGood Will Hunting‚Äù star seems to be fine after the split, saying that the 52-year-old actor ‚Äú</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">threw in the towel a long time ago.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While another insider told the outlet, ‚ÄúBen has been his usual, high-energetic self. He&#8217;s been busy with his kids and work and seems to be doing just fine.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the divorce filing, Lopez wrote that the separation occurred on April 26, </span><a href="https://people.com/ben-affleck-and-jennifer-lopez-divorce-live-updates-8699009"><span style="font-weight: 400;">People magazine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> noted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the same day reports surfaced that Lopez had filed for divorce, the ‚ÄúGone Girl‚Äù star was spotted not wearing his wedding ring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As to why she chose the anniversary of their wedding ceremony, a source told the outlet, ‚ÄúShe was done waiting and the date she did it speaks a ton.‚Äù¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move &#8220;gives her control of the process,&#8221; added the source. &#8220;It&#8217;s good that she did it.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One insider told </span><a href="https://people.com/jennifer-lopez-began-house-hunting-in-april-amid-ben-affleck-split-source-8699337?taid=66c64651235a150001a05460&amp;utm_campaign=peoplemagazine&amp;utm_content=new&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">People</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, ‚Äú</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She&#8217;s very disappointed and sad, but Ben hasn&#8217;t given her any signs that he wants to continue their marriage.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;She tried really hard to make things work and is heartbroken,‚Äù the source added. &#8220;The kids are a top priority, as they always have been.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In June, rumors surfaced that their marriage was over and a source at the time told the outlet that Affleck</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ‚Äústarted moving out a while ago. The marriage is completely over, and Jennifer is heartbroken. She loves love and wanted this to work so badly.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lopez and Affleck officially tied the knot in a legal ceremony in Las Vegas in 2022, before they celebrated their matrimony at a backyard ceremony at an $8 million Georgia mansion with family and friends a month later. It all happened 18 years after the couple first got engaged in 2002 before calling it off in 2004.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ‚ÄúDeep Water‚Äù star was previously married to actress Jennifer Garner for more than a decade. The two share three kids. Lopez has been married three times and shares two kids with her ex-husband singer Marc Anthony.</span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/topic/pbs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PBS News</a> reporter Judy Woodruff issued a retraction on Wednesday after she falsely reported at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was trying to sabotage a hostage deal between Hamas and Israel because it would help Democrat presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to clarify my remarks on the PBS News special on Monday night about the ongoing cease fire talks in the Middle East,&#8221; she said in a <a href="https://x.com/JudyWoodruff/status/1826330987359273176">post</a> on X. &#8220;As I said, this was not based on my original reporting; I was referring to reports I had read, in Axios and Reuters, about former President Trump having spoken to the Israeli Prime Minister.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the live TV moment, I repeated the story because I hadn&#8217;t seen later reporting that both sides denied it,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;This was a mistake and I apologize for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Woodruff said on Monday night: &#8220;The reporting is that former President Trump is on the phone with the Prime Minister of Israel, urging him not to cut a deal right now, because that it&#8217;s believed that would help the Harris campaign.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I don&#8217;t know where, where that&#8211;, I don&#8217;t know, who knows whether that will come about or not, but I have to think that the Harris campaign would like for President Biden to do what presidents do, which is work on that one,&#8221; she added.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas Children&#8217;s Hospital in Houston is the largest children&#8217;s hospital in the world. They treat more than four million patients under the age of 21 every year, most of them minors. And because of the hospital&#8217;s size and prestige, what happens at TCH doesn&#8217;t just affect those patients. What happens at TCH also influences how other major children&#8217;s hospitals all around the country conduct their operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s what makes the reporting out of Texas Children&#8217;s Hospital this year ‚Äî most of it done by Chris Rufo ‚Äî impossible to ignore. In the span of a little over a year, two whistleblowers have come forward to allege that TCH is systemically deceiving the public and potentially violating the law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first whistleblower, a general surgeon named Eithan Haim, provided records to Rufo which demonstrated that TCH had not, in fact, shut down its child sex-change program as promised. This was significant because the attorney general of Texas, Ken Paxton, had just released a legal opinion stating that child sex-change surgeries ‚Äî as well as cross-sex hormone treatments ‚Äî constitutes child abuse under Texas law. So TCH claimed that they shut the program down in order to avoid prosecution. As the hospital put it, they wanted to:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">safeguard our health care professionals and impacted families from potential criminal legal ramification.</span></i></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So they stood by the child sterilization, but they said they had no choice but to comply with the attorney general.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Rufo&#8217;s reporting, Haim provided redacted records proving that TCH then quietly restarted the program without informing the public. In effect, they didn&#8217;t really shut it down at all. Haim didn&#8217;t give Rufo any personally identifying information about any patients, and no personally identifiable information was ever released publicly. He provided only the information that was necessary to verify that TCH was continuing to perform procedures related to child sex-changes, in apparent defiance of the attorney general.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, the records reportedly demonstrated that TCH allowed a doctor to, ‚Äúinsert a non-biodegradable drug delivery implant‚Äù into an 11-year-old girl who identified as transgender. The records also indicated that several children between the ages of 11 and 15 received these implants, among many other procedures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Texas legislature clearly thought Haim&#8217;s revelations were worth acting on. The very next day after Rufo published his report on Haim&#8217;s claims, the Texas legislature voted ‚Äî in bipartisan fashion ‚Äî to ban so-called &#8220;gender-affirming care&#8221; for minors. So the attorney general&#8217;s legal opinion wasn&#8217;t just an opinion anymore. It was binding on hospitals like TCH.</span></p>
<h4><strong><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/episode/ep-1427-the-matt-walsh-show" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WATCH: The Matt Walsh Show</a></strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On these facts, there&#8217;s no question that Eithan Haim is a whistleblower by any definition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He chose to risk career ‚Äî which was just beginning ‚Äî to provide information that his employer might be systematically violating the law. And not just any law ‚Äî but a law designed to protect children from being abused and permanently sterilized. On top of that, Haim&#8217;s evidence indicated that TCH might be lying to the public, which is a pretty big deal when you&#8217;re talking about a children&#8217;s hospital. If they&#8217;re willing to lie about castrating children, it might lead you to wonder what else they&#8217;re willing to lie about, and how deep the corruption goes. Haim&#8217;s disclosures directly led to a substantial change in Texas law, in record time, which means that by definition, they were highly relevant to the public interest. You cannot define &#8220;whistleblower&#8221; anymore clearly than this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Joe Biden and Kamala Harris&#8217; DOJ didn&#8217;t see it that way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A month later, they sent federal agents to his door to inform him that he was under investigation for HIPAA violations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shortly afterwards, he was indicted. Watch:</span></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Houston doctor accused of releasing private patient information from Texas Children&#039;s Hospital" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UqGa0JvWi4s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So according to the DOJ, Eithan Haim wanted to cause &#8220;malicious harm&#8221; to the hospital. They&#8217;re not concerned about the permanent harm that this massive and well-funded hospital may be causing to children. Instead, the prosecutors are worried about the &#8220;harm&#8221; that the hospital might suffer when the public learns what it&#8217;s doing, in defiance of the attorney general and Texas law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a hospital that, by the way, receives a lot of money and tax breaks from the government. We have every right to know what it&#8217;s doing. But apparently the hospital&#8217;s employees are not allowed to &#8220;harm&#8221; the hospital by informing the public about the procedures they&#8217;re performing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might remember that Democrats didn&#8217;t always treat whistleblowers this way. During the Trump administration, a CIA operative who was assigned to the White House leaked classified recordings of Trump to Adam Schiff. That led to the first impeachment trial. We weren&#8217;t even allowed to know the CIA operative&#8217;s name at any point during the proceedings. Corporate media outlets refused to tell us. Even in Congress, lawmakers were told it was off-limits to reveal his identity. John Roberts, who was presiding over the impeachment, enforced that rule. This was a &#8220;whistleblower&#8221; who wasn&#8217;t even alleging that Trump had violated any law. And yet, this CIA employee was treated with such reverence that, to this day, we&#8217;re not allowed to say his name in public.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Eithan Haim ‚Äî who actually displayed real bravery, and who disclosed relevant information about a children&#8217;s hospital ‚Äî now faces up to a decade in prison if convicted. His life gets destroyed and his career is ended, all for telling the truth. And he&#8217;s not the only one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, a nurse named Vanessa Sivadge revealed that she was recently fired by Texas Children&#8217;s Hospital. Her crime was alleging that TCH bills Medicaid to provide puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones to children, in violation of federal law. TCH immediately denied this allegation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then the Biden administration sent more federal agents to harass her at her home, because that&#8217;s what happens when you start saying inconvenient things about so-called &#8220;gender affirming care.&#8221; Watch:</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is where we are now: The Biden Administration sent two FBI agents to intimidate a nurse who told the truth about the child sex-change program at Texas Children&#39;s Hospital. The regime is mobilizing to threaten and imprison anyone who opposes &quot;transgender medicine.&quot; <a href="https://t.co/XbtZVnp5Kw">pic.twitter.com/XbtZVnp5Kw</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Christopher F. Rufo ‚öîÔ∏è (@realchrisrufo) <a href="https://twitter.com/realchrisrufo/status/1803144650984714361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 18, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only reason these agents showed up to Sivadge&#8217;s home was to intimidate her. They weren&#8217;t there to arrest her. They weren&#8217;t there to inform her that she was the target of any investigation. The point was to imply that she&#8217;d better keep her mouth shut because the federal government was watching her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a letter to Rufo, Sivadge said she had attempted to transfer away from the endocrine unit as a last-ditch effort to avoid working in this area of so-called medicine, but the hospital refused her request:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This past Friday on August 16, TCH fired me effective immediately. This is unlawful for two reasons: it is retaliation for my coming forward with information on TCH‚Äôs egregious pattern of deception and Medicaid fraud, and this action also illegally disregarded my request to transfer due to my belief that these procedures provide irreversible harm and lifelong regret to children confused by their sex.</span></i></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it&#8217;s true that TCH is defrauding Medicaid, it wouldn&#8217;t be particularly surprising. Last year, I posted a Twitter thread looking to two of the largest so-called &#8220;trans healthcare&#8221; providers, known as Plume and Folx. And both of these providers indicated that they diagnose patients with &#8220;dysphoria,&#8221; even if they don&#8217;t really have it, in order to ensure that insurance pays out. In fact, Folx openly admitted doing this on their website. This is the kind of apparent fraud that can take place openly when your industry has the full backing of the Biden DOJ. When you know the government&#8217;s on your side, you can admit to fraud in public and no one does anything. It&#8217;s the people who point out the fraud who get harassed and even jailed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What&#8217;s particularly troubling about the situation at TCH is that Vanessa Sivadge was clearly in a position to know if the hospital was defrauding Medicaid. She interacted with doctors who were ordering various procedures and medications, and she coordinated prescription refills all the time. She once taught a child how to inject sex-change hormones. It was her job, which she performed up until the moment she realized how immoral it was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Sivadge put it:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the cardiac clinic, we were taking sick kids and making them better. In the transgender clinic, it was the opposite. We were harming these kids.</span></i></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So there&#8217;s only two possibilities here. Either this nurse is, for some reason, lying about her own first-hand observations, knowing it would completely destroy her career and her life. Or, like Eithan Haim, she&#8217;s telling the truth. And right now the latter explanation seems a lot more believable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to her termination, Sivadge </span><a href="https://x.com/V_Sivadge/status/1825580932385956052" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> just two words on social media: &#8220;Worth it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s the kind of response you&#8217;d expect from someone who knows that the Texas attorney general&#8217;s investigation is going to validate everything she said. It&#8217;s a rare example of bravery in an industry that&#8217;s sorely lacking it. And it&#8217;s exactly what it will take to end this insanity and stop the mutilation and sterilization of children.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These two whistleblowers alone have had a major impact. What happens next at Texas Children&#8217;s Hospital could determine what happens not just to the millions of children in their care, but to all the other children&#8217;s hospitals that look to TCH for guidance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What&#8217;s needed now is for more whistleblowers to come forward, to follow their conscience and to expose this fraudulent industry for what it is.</span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A coalition of 14 Republican attorneys general warned <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/topic/apple" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple</a> on Wednesday that its ‚Äúdiscriminatory‚Äù entrepreneur programs excluding white and Asian men may be illegal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Led by <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/topic/west-virginia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">West Virginia</a> Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, the Republican officials sent a letter to Apple after it opened up applications last week for its ‚ÄúEntrepreneurship Camp‚Äù exclusively for minorities and women. The letter, addressed to Apple Senior Vice President Katherine Adams, says that the application stipulations may violate federal discrimination law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúApple should abandon this wrong-headed and exclusionary approach. As it stands, the program reflects a troubling fixation on race and sex ‚Äî and looks to run afoul of anti-discrimination laws. While supporting up-and-coming developers may be a laudable goal, this harmful strategy is not the way to do it,‚Äù the attorneys general <a href="https://ago.wv.gov/Documents/Apple%20Letter.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúAnd given how you sell your products in our States‚Äîand recruit developers, engineers, and others from our States, too‚Äîwe cannot give tacit approval to your methods. Indeed, by hosting some of these camps remotely, we think Apple is effectively exporting discrimination to our States,‚Äù they added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joining Morrisey were the attorneys general of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Texas.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amiracist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amiracist.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1724211156439000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2-L2DitSaIUj5wz8v0bgxx"><b>Tickets for ‚ÄúAm I Racist?‚Äù are on sale NOW! Buy here for a theater near you.</b></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple faced backlash from conservatives last week after it <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=49500drc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> its requirements for its ‚ÄúApple Entrepreneur Camp‚Äù on August 13. According to the tech company, the camp ‚Äúsupports underrepresented founders and developers, and encourages the pipeline and longevity of these entrepreneurs in technology.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The posting from the company said that all ‚Äúfemale,* Black, Hispanic/Latinx, and Indigenous‚Äù developers were welcome to apply. The asterisks around ‚Äúfemale‚Äù pointed to a note that said that Apple ‚Äúbelieves that gender expression is a fundamental right. We welcome all women to apply to this program.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republicans said that Apple was sowing social division through the program and pushing ‚Äúintentional discrimination.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúIf Apple wants to open the doors to underrepresented persons, we can conceive of plenty of ways to do so without engaging in ugly race- and sex-based classifications. It could target those who don‚Äôt hail from elite educational institutions,‚Äù they wrote. ‚ÄúIt could target those from lower socio-economic classes. It could target persons from parts of our country that haven‚Äôt yet experienced a boom in app development.‚Äù</span></p>
<p>In recent months, corporations around the country have faced backlash from customers for pushing woke policies and implementing DEI requirements.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The actor has discussed his relationship with </span><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/topic/christianity"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christianity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before. In 2022, he spoke with The Wrap about keeping Christ at the center of his ‚ÄúSanta Clauses‚Äù series on Disney+.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúIt originally had a lot of otherworldly characters, and ghosts, and goblins. I said no, this is Christ-mas. It&#8217;s Christ-mas. It literally is a religious holiday,‚Äù Allen </span><a href="https://www.thewrap.com/the-santa-clauses-christianity-tim-allen-disney-series/#brid_cp_Brid_1178858"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the outlet. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have to blow trumpets, but I do want you to acknowledge it. That‚Äôs what this is about. If you want to get into Santa Claus, you‚Äôre gonna have to go back to history, and it‚Äôs all about religion.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2011, Allen opened up about his struggle with faith following his father‚Äôs death after being struck by a drunk driver. The actor was 11 years old at the time of the accident.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúFor years, I just did not like this idea of God, church,‚Äù he said at the time, per </span><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2011/11/funnyman-tim-allen-serious-about-god"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ABC News</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. ‚Äú[I was] still a churchgoer, but constantly a cynic.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said he eventually started referring to God as ‚ÄúThe Builder.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúI always do ask‚Ä¶The Builder, what did you want me to do?‚Äù Allen said. ‚ÄúAnd I do ask it. But you‚Äôve got to be prepared for the answer.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúWhoever built me, this is too much, too weird that it happened by accident,‚Äù Allen added. ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt happen by accident.‚Äù</span></p>

      <description>The Republican National Committee paid for the domain kamala2024policies.com and created a website listing some of Vice President Kamala Harris&amp;#8217; &amp;#8220;dangerously liberal policies&amp;#8221; as her own campaign website still does not have a policy platform.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Republican National Committee paid for the domain <a href="https://kamala2024policies.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kamala2024policies.com</a> and created a website listing some of Vice President Kamala Harris&#8217; &#8220;dangerously liberal policies&#8221; as her own campaign website still <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/kamala-campaign-website-still-lacks-policy-platform-after-start-of-dnc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">does not have</a> a policy platform.</p>
<p>The website features Harris&#8217; leftist record on issues such as criminal justice, immigration, the economy, and the Green New Deal. The Democratic candidate has been blasted by Republicans for her campaign website lacking any policy agenda or list of important issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kamala Harris is weak, failed, and dangerously liberal,&#8221; the website <a href="https://kamala2024policies.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">states</a>. &#8220;Not only does Kamala Harris own the weakness, failure, and chaos of the Harris-Biden administration, she is so radical that she makes &#8216;the Squad&#8217; look like moderates. She wants to abolish our borders, let criminals control our streets, surrender our communities to cartels and a plague of fentanyl, wage war on American energy, and destroy the American Dream.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harris&#8217; first policy proposal on August 6 was a promise to eliminate taxes on tips for service and hospitality workers, the same proposal offered by former President Donald Trump on June 9. The Democratic candidate rolled out economic promises last week, vowing to institute price controls on food items and hand out up to $25,000 to first-time homeowners. Despite making the sweeping promises to voters at a campaign rally in North Carolina, Harris&#8217; <a href="https://kamalaharris.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaign website</a> offers no more detail on what these policies entail.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amiracist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amiracist.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1724211156439000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2-L2DitSaIUj5wz8v0bgxx"><b>Tickets for ‚ÄúAm I Racist?‚Äù are on sale NOW! Buy here for a theater near you.</b></a></p>
<p>Trump and Republicans have begun referring to Harris&#8217; economic policies as &#8220;communist,&#8221; and the former president has called his opponent &#8220;Comrade Kamala&#8221; multiple times.</p>
<p>&#8220;After causing catastrophic inflation, Comrade Kamala announced that she wants to institute socialist price controls,&#8221; Trump <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-slams-harris-call-ban-price-gouging-37-states-already-rcna167158" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> a crowd of his supporters in Pennsylvania last weekend.</p>
<p>The RNC highlighted some of Harris&#8217; past comments on health care when she called for the elimination of private health insurance while campaigning during the 2020 Democratic primary. Harris also <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/kamalas-campaign-says-she-will-not-push-medicare-for-all-she-fully-supported-it-5-years-ago" target="_blank" rel="noopener">co-sponsored</a> a bill put forward by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) to switch to a single-payer &#8220;Medicare-for-All&#8221; plan, which would have made the federal government completely responsible for covering health care costs.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://www.amiracist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.amiracist.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1724211156439000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2xQ8bdTcpfdrPBAzczIuck">WATCH THE TRAILER FOR ‚ÄòAM I RACIST?‚Äô ‚Äî A MATT WALSH COMEDY ON DEI</a></b></p>
<p>As pointed out on kamala2024policies.com, Harris also <a href="https://x.com/VP/status/1734278791889891624" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boasted</a> about &#8220;delivering on the most ambitious climate agenda in history&#8221; and has said she supports banning fracking and canceling the Keystone XL pipeline.</p>
<p>As the DNC kicked off earlier this week, the party&#8217;s delegates approved the 2024 Democratic platform, which still <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/democrats-release-2024-platform-it-still-says-joe-biden-is-running-to-finish-the-job" target="_blank" rel="noopener">referred</a> to President Joe Biden as the nominee. According to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/16/harris-dnc-democrats-message-policies-00174195" target="_blank" rel="noopener">POLITICO</a>, some congressional Democrats want Harris to keep quiet on her exact platform until after the election, which would be an unprecedented move for a presidential nominee.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday night, Obama took the stage at the DNC in Chicago to loud cheers and applause as the former president took one swipe after another against Trump, appearing, at one point, to reference the size of 45‚Äôs lower anatomy, </span><a href="https://www.bizpacreview.com/2024/08/21/barack-obama-makes-crude-hand-gesture-mocking-trumps-anatomy-then-scolds-him-for-childish-nicknames-1481428/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BizPacReview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúHere is a 78-year-old billionaire [Trump] who has not stopped whining about his problems since he rode down his golden escalator nine years ago,‚Äù Obama told the audience of Democrat supporters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúA constant stream of gripes, grievances that has been getting worse now that he is afraid to lose to Kamala [Harris],‚Äù he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúThe childish nicknames, crazy conspiracy theories, this weird obsession with crowd sizes,‚Äù Obama continued, as he motioned with his hands, moving them in from large to small, while appearing to look down at his groin.</span></p>

<p>The promise appeared in Trump&#8217;s prepared remarks for his Tuesday rally at the Livingston County Sheriff‚Äôs Department in Howell, Michigan. Excerpts of his prepared remarks were released by his campaign ahead of the event.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd to protect our children from sexual mutilation, we will make it a felony for any medical professional to perform surgery on a minor without parental consent,‚Äù Trump&#8217;s remarks read.</p>
<p>Members of the Trump campaign shared the news about the former president&#8217;s vow on social media.</p>

<p>Trump&#8217;s remarks also said he would be &#8220;asking for the death penalty for child rapists and child traffickers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Transgender medical interventions on minors, which include double mastectomies of girls&#8217; healthy breasts as well as puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones, have become one of the most controversial cultural issues of the last several years.</p>
<p>The Biden administration has pushed to keep such interventions legal for minors, arguing against age restrictions for some transgender procedures in one Alabama court case, documents <a href="https://cbs6albany.com/amp/news/nation-world/trump-will-charge-doctors-for-sexual-mutilation-of-children-campaign-says-donald-trump-politics-2024-election-lgbt-transgender-minors-surgeries-surgery-felony-charge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">show</a>.</p>
<p>At least 25 U.S. states have <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/nebraska-supreme-court-upholds-bans-on-abortion-transgender-surgeries-for-minors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed</a> restrictions on transgender surgeries and hormone treatments for minors. Republicans in state legislatures have butted heads with Democrats on whether to keep the treatments legal.</p>
<p>Transgender surgeries like double mastectomy and phalloplasty for females and vaginoplasty for males are not reversible. Genital surgeries are less commonly performed on children, but some trans-identifying minors go on to receive them as adults. Some of the effects of hormone treatments, such as voice damage, are also irreversible.</p>
<p>Last year, Trump <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-vows-stop-gender-affirming-care-minors-re-elected-president-rcna68461" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> to task several federal agencies with working to ‚Äústop‚Äù transgender medical interventions for minors, calling it ‚Äúchild abuse.‚Äù</p>
<p>Additionally, Trump had said he would prohibit federal agencies from working to ‚Äúpromote the concept of sex and gender transition at any age.‚Äù</p>

<p>Detransitioners, people who underwent transgender surgeries and hormone treatments at a young age but now express regrets, have <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/it-was-mutilation-5-detransitioners-harmed-by-medical-transition-speak-out-in-new-documentary">spoken out</a> in recent years about how the treatments harmed them. Some have accused their doctors of not addressing their underlying mental issues, such as autism, anxiety, or depression, before shunting them towards transgender medicalization.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, parents have reacted strongly to public schools secretly affirming their children&#8217;s new gender identities behind their backs.</p>
<p>More than 19,000 schools across the country have rules saying school staff can or should hide a student‚Äôs gender identity from parents, according to <a href="https://defendinged.org/investigations/list-of-school-district-transgender-gender-nonconforming-student-policies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a list</a> compiled by Parents Defending Education.</p>
<p>Only about 44% of Democrats said they are opposed to schools counseling children on their sexual orientation and gender identity without parental knowledge, one <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/less-than-half-of-dems-oppose-schools-counseling-children-about-gender-without-parental-consent-poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll</a> found last year.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/topic/robert-f-kennedy-jr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a> is reportedly set to drop out of the presidential race this week and will address the nation while speaking in the same city as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.</p>
<p>ABC News <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/rfk-jr-plans-drop-presidential-race-end-week/story?id=113028999&amp;cid=social_twitter_abcn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Kennedy will drop out by the end of the week and is leaning toward endorsing Trump, but no decision has been finalized.</p>
<p>Kennedy&#8217;s campaign said that he will make a live address on Friday in Phoenix, which comes as Trump will be holding a rally in Glendale, Arizona, which is a suburb of Phoenix.</p>
<p>Trump said this week that he was open to Kennedy joining his administration if Kennedy were to drop out and endorse him, which could put Trump over the edge this fall against Democrat presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a brilliant guy. He‚Äôs a very smart guy. I‚Äôve known him for a very long time,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know he was thinking about getting out, but if he is thinking about getting out, certainly I‚Äôd be open to it.‚Äù</p>
<p>Trump said that he would ‚Äúlove‚Äù an endorsement from Kennedy because he‚Äôs ‚Äúalways liked‚Äù him.</p>
<p>He indicated that he ‚Äúprobably would‚Äù appoint Kennedy to a role in the administration if Kennedy were to drop out and endorse him.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI like him a lot. I respect him a lot,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúI probably would, if something like that would happen. He‚Äôs a very different kind of a guy ‚Äî a very smart guy. And, yeah, I would be honored by that endorsement, certainly.‚Äù</p>

      <description>CNN Republican commentator Scott Jennings keyed in on a bit of irony during the network&amp;#8217;s coverage of the Democratic National Convention ‚Äî namely that Democrats want Americans to believe they can fix inflation, the border, and other issues despite the fact that they have controlled the White House for 12 of the last 16 years ...</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CNN Republican commentator Scott Jennings keyed in on a bit of irony during the network&#8217;s coverage of the Democratic National Convention ‚Äî namely that Democrats want Americans to believe they can fix inflation, the border, and other issues despite the fact that they have controlled the <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/topic/white-house" target="_blank" rel="noopener">White House</a> for 12 of the last 16 years and have not done so.</p>
<p>Jennings broached the topic during a panel discussion hosted by CNN anchor Anderson Cooper ‚Äî and he asked, among other things, why Vice President Kamala Harris was promising to fix things as president that she did not appear to have any interest in fixing while she was vice president.</p>
<p><strong>WATCH:</strong></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Wow‚Ä¶just wow.</p>
<p>Look at the faces on the CNN panel as a huge truth bomb is dropped.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDemocrats have controlled the White House for 12 of the last 16 years, and somehow, it‚Äôs still all Trump‚Äôs fault.‚Äù <a href="https://t.co/JFc9zBPAS1">pic.twitter.com/JFc9zBPAS1</a></p>
<p>‚Äî SweetPeaBelle (@SweetPeaBell326) <a href="https://twitter.com/SweetPeaBell326/status/1826202683612545344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s in the White House right now,&#8221; Jennings said of Harris. &#8220;Democrats have controlled the White House for 12 of the last 16 years, and for all of the talk about division and the problems of the country, people are hurting ‚Äî Democrats have mostly controlled the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trump had it for four, but the Obamas and Biden had it for the rest of the time,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;And somehow, it&#8217;s still all Trump&#8217;s fault, and somehow, [Harris] hasn&#8217;t been at the center of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jennings concluded by asking why Americans should believe that Harris could solve problems as president that she did not appear to even be working on as vice president.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amiracist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amiracist.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1723831707612000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0pyrv88A5nsmWM2F2Wr9As"><b>Tickets for ‚ÄúAm I Racist?‚Äù are on sale NOW! Buy here for a theater near you.</b></a></p>
<p>&#8220;So to me, that&#8217;s still the glaring hole in this campaign that hasn&#8217;t yet been solved at the convention: How do you explain all of the problems that will be solved by the person who is currently in there for the last three-and-a-half years, who is supposed to already be working on solving it?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even know there was a job opening on ‚ÄòHappy Gilmore 2.‚Äô I‚Äôll be a f***ing extra‚Ä¶ anything to get around Happy Gilmore, an Adam Sandler film or set ‚Äî count me in,‚Äù he said at the time.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelce‚Äôs brother and podcast co-host, Jason Kelce, shut down the rumors, saying there was ‚Äúno evidence‚Äù the cameo was happening.</span></p>

      <description>A recent study suggests that the overall tone of legacy media coverage is so biased that it could be considered election interference.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A recent study suggests that the overall tone of legacy media coverage is so biased that it could be considered election interference.</p>
<p>The Media Research Center <a href="https://newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/rich-noyes/2024/08/19/study-networks-deliver-massive-media-honeymoon-kamala-harris" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evaluated</a> the major network coverage of the 2024 presidential race ‚Äî specifically Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump ‚Äî in the weeks since President Joe Biden was effectively forced off the ticket by prominent members of his own party. The results, they said, indicated a dramatic bias in favor of Harris ‚Äî in terms of both the amount of airtime and tone of coverage.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amiracist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amiracist.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1724211156439000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2-L2DitSaIUj5wz8v0bgxx"><b>Tickets for ‚ÄúAm I Racist?‚Äù are on sale NOW!

<p>&#8220;It‚Äôs all part of the media‚Äôs massive brainwashing enterprise in support of Kamala,&#8221; Fox News host Greg Gutfeld said.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The bias was apparent first in the amount of airtime given to Harris over Trump between July 21 ‚Äî the day Biden announced he was leaving the presidential race ‚Äî to August 17: Harris received 221 minutes of coverage during evening newscasts on ABC, CBS, and NBC. Trump received 133 minutes of coverage during that same period of time.</p>
<p>It is important to note the context ‚Äî namely, that even though the Democratic Party was in upheaval as it changed candidates and then Harris selected her running mate, the timeframe studied also began just after the Republican National Convention and Trump&#8217;s selection of Sen. JD Vance (R-OH) to be his VP, and just over one week after he had been shot at a Pennsylvania rally.</p>
<p>Still, the coverage of the vice presidential candidates bore out a similar pattern. Over the course of 28 days, Vance saw just over 31 minutes of airtime. Minnesota Democratic Governor Tim Walz, Harris&#8217; VP pick, saw just under 32 minutes of airtime, but he got all that coverage in half the time because the clock did not start for him until August 6.</p>
<p>The tone of the coverage showed an even wider gap between the candidates. Evening news coverage included 57 positive comments about Harris and only 11 negative, which translated to a positive spin score of 84%. ¬†Trump, on the other hand, had only 11 positive statements and 86 negative, which gave him a negative spin score of 89%.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://www.amiracist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.amiracist.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1724211156439000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2xQ8bdTcpfdrPBAzczIuck">WATCH THE TRAILER FOR ‚ÄòAM I RACIST?‚Äô ‚Äî A MATT WALSH COMEDY ON DEI</a></b></p>
<p>Again, the same trend continued with the vice presidential candidates: Walz received a 62% positive spin score, and Vance received a 92% negative spin score.</p>
<p>In addition to all of that, major media outlets have continued to downplay issues that could negatively impact either Harris or the Democratic Party ‚Äî while negative stories about Trump or Republicans continue to grow legs.</p>
<p>The real question, MRC concluded, would be whether or not the public would see through the &#8220;extraordinarily lopsided coverage.&#8221;</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The slate of prominent Irish-American Democrats who gathered to express their support for Kamala Harris struggled to stay on topic.</p>
<p>At times, it felt like last Tuesday&#8217;s ‚Äúnational organizing call‚Äù for Irish-Americans supporting Vice President Kamala Harris&#8217;s campaign could have been something the Democratic National Committee planned before the country‚Äôs Irish-American president took himself off the ticket. But if the event itself felt odd, it was hardly out of place on the Harris-Walz campaign schedule.</p>
<p>The campaign has divvied voters up by their race at several virtual events over the last several weeks. &#8220;White Dudes For Harris&#8221; made a particular splash, as did &#8220;White Women For Kamala,&#8221; which <a href="https://cbsaustin.com/news/nation-world/tiktoker-instructs-white-women-to-never-correct-bipoc-people-during-virtual-harris-event-tiktok-arielle-fodor-white-women-for-kamala-harris-2024-election-politics-democrat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">featured</a> a TikTok influencer who adopted a condescending tone ‚Äî known as &#8220;gentle parenting&#8221; on social media ‚Äî to tell the attendees they should never correct people of color.</p>
<p>There are &#8220;For Harris&#8221; events for every conceivable identity group: black voters, South Asians, Jews, and more. But the event aimed at Irish-Americans seemed particularly awkward in the wake of the Democratic Party&#8217;s defenestration of a very-Irish president who is very proud of his heritage.</p>
<p>As New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said on the call, President Joe Biden was, along with John F. Kennedy, one of the &#8220;most Irish-American presidents in the history of our nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>At one point, the call became a true Kennedy fest when JFK‚Äôs grandnephew and niece, Joe Kennedy III and Rory Kennedy, chimed in at the same time. Rory Kennedy told a story about a family rosary that was sentimental to her famous Irish-American political family.</p>
<p>Biden <a href="https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2022/07/19/joe-biden-bethlehem-church-243380" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sometimes</a> carries a rosary in his pocket and goes to Mass regularly, although he famously flouts the Catholic Church‚Äôs doctrine on abortion, gender ideology, and other issues.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn Scranton, Irish Catholic Democrat is one word,‚Äù Virginia McGregor, DNC treasurer and national co-chair of Women for Harris said on the call.</p>
<p>Biden himself did not join Tuesday‚Äôs call, although Murphy said the president would likely be ‚Äúquoting an Irish poet or two‚Äù if he were there.</p>
<p>Some of the speakers came armed with jokes.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI think the only thing Donald Trump really understands about Ireland or the Irish culture is the McDonald&#8217;s Shamrock Shake every March,‚Äù said Congressman Brendan Boyle (D-PA).</p>
<p>‚ÄúMost important, they‚Äôre not weird,‚Äù Representative Mary Gay Scanlon (D-PA) said about Irish-Americans in her swing state district, referencing the recent online barb from Democrats that the Trump-Vance ticket is ‚Äúweird.‚Äù</p>
<p>Rounding out the call was a bizarre appearance from actress and singer Lynda Carter, known for playing Wonder Woman in the &#8217;70s, who began her remarks by talking about how she didn‚Äôt like her father‚Äôs ‚Äúlast wife‚Äù trying to cut his bushy Irish eyebrows.</p>
<p>Carter also ranted about abortion ‚Äî at one point appearing to forget the word contraception ‚Äî and about men who support former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe‚Äôs really not for those men either because he wants to take away their condoms,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey want to take reproductive freedom. They want to take away ‚Äî they want to take away not only our right to choose but, what do you call it? You know. Condoms and all of it. I‚Äôve just lost my way. I get all excited.‚Äù</p>
<p>Former Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe quipped that Democrats ‚Äúneed the Irish because God gave us the gift of gab.&#8221;</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre good talkers. There‚Äôs no one better at the doors,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe only problem, when we do door-to-door, we spend too long at each door.‚Äù</p>
<p>Biden is a ‚Äúspectacular president,‚Äù and Kamala will also be a ‚Äúspectacular president,‚Äù McAuliffe said.</p>
<p>Actor Michael Kelly, known for ‚ÄúHouse Of Cards,‚Äù also joined the call and said the country is at an ‚Äúinflection point.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúLet me tell you, if there is anything that my Irish brothers and sisters know it is how to work,‚Äù the actor said of campaigning for Harris.</p>
<p>Also joining the call were Reps. Tim Kennedy (D-NY) and Dan Kildee (D-MI). All of the speakers told listeners to sign up for the Harris campaign‚Äôs text alerts for Irish-American supporters.</p>
<p>Biden ‚Äúembodied completely‚Äù the Irish qualities of working hard and doing what is right when he dropped out of the 2024 race, McGregor, the DNC treasurer said. She also claimed that, ‚Äúyou cannot travel abroad without hearing how our country‚Äôs global standing has been restored.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre at your summer barbecues make sure you have three quick points about why you‚Äôre voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz,‚Äù she added.</p>
<p>Harris and Tim Walz ‚Äúshare the values of the Irish community‚Äù as well, Murphy assured, urging supporters, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs leave no shamrock unturned‚Äù in supporting the new ticket.</p>
<p>‚ÄúKamala Harris, Tim Walz, the Irish, unbeatable!‚Äù the New Jersey governor said.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the family of a North Carolina man hit and killed in a hit-and-run last year awaits the sentencing of the suspected illegal immigrant who drove the car, the victim&#8217;s mother¬†</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is calling out what she sees as a double standard in the justice system.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twenty-year-old Michael Archuleta, known to loved ones as ‚ÄúLittle Mike,‚Äù was struck and killed by a motorist on November 13 while riding his bike in Brunswick County. Archuleta had almost made it to his family‚Äôs driveway when the suspect, Maria Concepcion Cardona Alejo, allegedly hit him with her 2002 Toyota Sequoia.¬†</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alejo allegedly fled the scene of the accident, but was arrested three days later and charged with felony hit-and-run and driving without a license.</span></p>
<p>Archuleta&#8217;s mother, Emily Carpenter, told The Daily Wire it&#8217;s &#8220;not fair&#8221; that her son <span style="font-weight: 400;">‚Äî who had recently scheduled an appointment to get his driver‚Äôs license ‚Äî was killed by an illegal immigrant repeatedly charged with unlicensed driving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúShe was in their courtrooms ten times and they knew that she was just going to keep doing it [breaking the law] because all she has to do is pay her little bit of money and then go down the road,‚Äù Carpenter said.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between 2009 and 2021, Alejo was given a citation at least seven different times for driving without a license and was slapped with small fines for the infractions. In a 2020 incident, Alejo was pulled over for failing to stop at a flashing red light, along with not having a valid driver‚Äôs license, and was fined $50.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Brunswick County Sheriff‚Äôs booking report, Alejo is a Mexican national. She posted bail a few hours after being detained. Only a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=2522a36a80fb9dc4&amp;rlz=1C5GCCM_en&amp;q=Maria+Concepcion+Cardona+Alejo&amp;tbm=nws&amp;source=lnms&amp;fbs=AEQNm0Aa4sjWe7Rqy32pFwRj0UkWd8nbOJfsBGGB5IQQO6L3J_86uWOeqwdnV0yaSF-x2jrJh7Dt5wV71ckxEPe_0GQyc61_Jkg5ZI9z4zNW20fWd2tUn_HrTAULuFP7u75dytEkiWC15l7moHi_nYsx6bYU7gYxjHncfuRcjwgxByi-2dbm91Px5JKg1Jotj8vdUSEMemJ8XA6RB42LqHkYBEFrl5n20w&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj6vZCh0YaIAxXe8MkDHSn-AOMQ0pQJegQIDRAB&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=779&amp;dpr=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">few local outlets</a> reported on Archuleta‚Äôs killing and Alejo‚Äôs arrest in November, and the story has gone unreported since then.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) spokesman told The Daily Wire that he could not confirm if Alejo is in the United States illegally because she was bailed out of jail before ICE could issue a detainer request. In order for ICE to issue a detainer, a suspect must be interviewed by an agent in person to determine his or her status.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Carpenter told The Daily Wire that she was informed by the district attorney‚Äôs office that Alejo is an illegal immigrant. The grieving mother blasted the system of justice that allows an illegal immigrant to ‚Äúhabitually break the law‚Äù with little consequence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alejo is expected to plead guilty to the fatal hit-and-run at her sentencing hearing in North Carolina Superior Court on August 26, according to the Bladen, Brunswick, and Columbus County District Attorney‚Äôs Office. </span></p>

Buy here for a theater near you.</b></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The morning after the fatal hit-and-run, Archuleta‚Äôs father, Mikie, was taking the family dog outside when a neighbor boy yelled to him, ‚ÄúYour son is dead in the ditch,‚Äù Carpenter recalls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúSo my husband goes running down there ‚Äî with my youngest 10-year-old son following behind him ‚Äî and he jumps into the ditch and my son is hard and cold.‚Äù¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúI‚Äôve been numb ever since,‚Äù Carpenter added. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt live there anymore because my son died in that ditch.‚Äù¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carpenter said her son was riding his bike back from a friend‚Äôs house when he was killed, adding that Archuleta‚Äôs bike had reflectors and that he was wearing a brightly colored sweatshirt. Archuleta was developmentally delayed, which put him slightly behind his peers on milestones such as graduating high school and learning how to drive.¬†</span></p>
<p><b><a href="http://www.amiracist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.amiracist.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1724211156439000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2xQ8bdTcpfdrPBAzczIuck">WATCH THE TRAILER FOR ‚ÄòAM I RACIST?‚Äô ‚Äî A MATT WALSH COMEDY ON DEI</a></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carpenter said she has been disappointed with the district attorney‚Äôs handling of the case, saying the assistant district attorney assigned to prosecute her son‚Äôs alleged killer is ‚Äúnot even trying‚Äù to seek a proper sentence. The district attorney&#8217;s office told The Daily Wire it could not comment on the ongoing case. When asked if it could confirm that Alijo is in the country illegally, the DA‚Äôs office told The Daily Wire to seek that information from federal authorities.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Archuleta enjoyed working with his hands and planned to become a mechanic. Carpenter said her son was a ‚Äúladies&#8217; man,‚Äù and that she was looking forward to the day she would become a grandmother to his children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Archuleta‚Äôs family faced more tragedy earlier this year when Mikie Archuleta‚Äôs cousin, Nicholas Simpson, was killed in a </span><a href="https://www.wmbfnews.com/2024/04/04/coroner-ids-motorcyclist-killed-deadly-n-myrtle-beach-hit-and-run/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hit-and-run</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by another alleged illegal immigrant in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Illegal immigration and the border crisis have become top concerns for voters heading into the 2024 election as border encounters have skyrocketed under the Biden-Harris administration. In the past year, many have expressed outrage after Americans </span><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/illegal-immigrant-charged-with-laken-rileys-murder-is-active-gang-member-report"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laken Riley</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/once-deported-illegal-immigrant-charged-with-murder-in-shooting-death-of-25-year-old-michigan-woman"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ruby Garcia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/mother-of-12-year-old-alleged-murdered-by-venezuelan-illegal-aliens-speaks-out"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jocelyn Nungary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/illegal-immigrant-from-el-salvador-arrested-charged-with-raping-and-murdering-a-maryland-mother"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rachel Morin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/authorities-believe-man-charged-in-murder-of-nashville-restaurant-owner-is-illegal-immigrant"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matt Carney</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, were allegedly murdered by migrants who had crossed the border illegally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carpenter and her family, like the families of those Americans killed, continue to await justice for a loved one.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked what Carpenter believes would be a proper sentence for Alijo, she told The Daily Wire, ‚ÄúShe gave me a life sentence. I have to deal with this pain the rest of my life.‚Äù¬†¬†</span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HOWELL, M.I. ‚Äî Supporters of former President <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/topic/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> showed up in force on Tuesday afternoon outside of the Livingston County Sheriff‚Äôs Office in <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/topic/michigan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michigan</a> as the former president gave a speech on law and order at a private event.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least one thousand Trump supporters descended upon Howell, about 55 miles northeast of Detroit, to line the streets outside the sheriff‚Äôs office where Trump was speaking. Many wore shirts and hats featuring the now-famous picture of Trump being rushed off the rally stage in Pennsylvania after he was nearly killed in an assassination attempt.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to try to make sure that our folks get as much exposure to the president as possible,‚Äù Livingston GOP Chair Rob Rodriguez-Pelizzari told The Daily Wire outside the sheriff‚Äôs office. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not an everyday occurrence where we get to talk with or even see the President of the United States. We‚Äôre really pumped up about it.‚Äù¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rodriguez-Pelizzari said he would love to host a rally for Trump in the county, which backed Trump by wide margins in 2016 and 2020. He said he handed out all of the 1,000 Trump signs he had ready for the day, adding that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans need to maximize voter turnout in red counties like Livingston because there are ‚Äúa lot of voters that aren‚Äôt voting.‚Äù¬†</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amiracist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amiracist.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1724211156439000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2-L2DitSaIUj5wz8v0bgxx"><b>Tickets for ‚ÄúAm I Racist?‚Äù are on sale NOW! Buy here for a theater near you.</b></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2016, Rodriguez-Pelizzari said everyone was ‚Äúsuper excited‚Äù about the election, saying that turnout in Livingston County was the ‚Äúlinchpin‚Äù of Trump‚Äôs victory in Michigan. Trump won the county by 31,000 votes and the election by about 11,000.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We feel like we‚Äôre pretty important,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe feel like we have to do a really good job here. His presidency is depending on it.‚Äù¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rodriguez-Pelizzari said that energy dipped in 2020 and 2022, but ‚Äúwe‚Äôre back again,‚Äù and ‚Äúeverybody is excited‚Äù for November. He said Republicans in the area were ‚Äúvery mobilized‚Äù and ‚Äúvery responsive.‚Äù¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Trump supporter named Scott, who works in casino management and lives in Brighton, was confident that Trump would perform well in Michigan this year. He said that the ‚Äúsilent majority was not going to be silent anymore,‚Äù adding that he didn‚Äôt trust the polls.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said his biggest issues were illegal immigration, high grocery prices, and the economy. He was especially critical of Vice President Kamala Harris‚Äôs price control proposals.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott was skeptical of Harris&#8217; promises to fix the economy, the border, and inflation since the Biden-Harris administration has already been in office for nearly four years.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a Midwest voter, he said that he believes the Democrat&#8217;s vice presidential candidate, Tim Walz, is ‚Äúmore liberal than Kamala,‚Äù and he&#8217;s worried about his ‚Äúincredibly deep ties to China.‚Äù¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A group of pro-life Christians was also outside the sheriff&#8217;s office, rallying for a woman named Heather Idoni, who has been incarcerated at the Livingston County Jail for her conviction on FACE Act-related charges. Several of those demonstrating held signs saying ‚ÄúFree Heather Idoni.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idoni and six other pro-life Christians were <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/breaking-89-year-old-woman-convicted-faces-over-a-decade-in-prison-for-peaceful-pro-life-protest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">convicted in Detroit</a> earlier in the day on Tuesday on FACE Act and conspiracy against rights charges brought by the Biden-Harris administration. Several of those convicted, including Eva Edl, Cal Zastrow, and Eva Zastrow, were present with the ‚Äúfree Heather‚Äù signs.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his speech, Trump said that Harris was weak on crime and that there was a spree of lawlessness sweeping Democrat-run cities.&#8221;You can&#8217;t walk across the street to get a loaf of bread,‚Äù he <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2024/08/20/donald-trump-howell-michigan-crime-campaign-speech-kamala-harris-illegal-immigration/74844154007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>. ‚ÄúYou get shot.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan is one of the battleground states that could decide the 2024 election. </span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Minnesota Governor Tim Walz comes under fire for making misleading claims about his <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/tim-walz-repeatedly-misconstrued-his-military-service-here-are-the-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">military service</a>, <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/another-lie-tim-walz-did-not-use-ivf-to-start-family-as-hes-repeatedly-claimed-in-attacks-against-trump-ticket" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IVF treatments</a>, and <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/cnn-admits-tim-walz-campaign-lied-about-his-drunk-driving-arrest-numerous-times" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drunk driving arrest,</a> it seems the vice presidential nominee has also made dubious claims about winning teaching awards.</p>
<p>A Daily Wire review found several claims that Walz, a former high school teacher, won either one or two Minnesota Teacher of the Year awards. In reality, he won no such title.</p>
<p>In a 2005 article in the Austin Daily Herald, a reporter who appears to have gotten his information directly from Walz wrote that ‚ÄúTwice, [Walz] was selected a Minnesota teacher of the year for ethics and excellence in education.‚Äù</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">A local paper&#8217;s glowing profile of Tim Walz in 2005:</p>
<p>Walz &#8220;served a tour of duty in Operation Iraqi Freedom&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was deployed overseas with his National Guard field artillery unit in Operation Iraqi Freedom.&#8221;</p>

<p>Walz&#8217;s <a href="https://justfacts.votesmart.org/candidate/biography/65443/tim-walz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biography</a> at VoteSmart lists three teaching awards ‚Äî a 2002 ‚ÄúEthics in Education,&#8221; award, a 2003 Minnesota Teacher of Excellence award, and the 2003 Mankato Teacher of the Year award.</p>
<p>In a 2006 congressional campaign ad, a voiceover simply claims that Walz was ‚Äúteacher of the year,‚Äù¬† leaving the impression Walz won a state or national award.</p>

<p>A 2006 <a href="https://www.csc.edu/news/2006/csc-graduate-elected-to-congress.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> from Walz‚Äôs alma mater, Chadron State College, claimed &#8220;In 2002, Walz was one of six Minnesota teachers to receive a $10,000 award recognizing their high performances and contributions to the teaching profession. He also received an Ethics in Education award from the Minnesota Academic Excellence Foundation.‚Äù</p>
<p>Walz&#8217;s 2018 campaign website reportedly claimed he won the 2003 Minnesota Teacher of Excellence award, <a href="https://www.ontheissues.org/2024/Tim_Walz_Education.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to On The Issues</a>, which cites the website. The website no longer exists, and instead redirects visitors to Vice President Kamala Harris‚Äô main campaign website.</p>
<p>But Walz was never selected as a Minnesota Teacher of the Year recipient. A¬† <a href="https://educationminnesota.org/news/awards-and-honors/teacher-of-the-year/past-recipients/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a> for the award includes a list of past nominees ‚Äì and Walz‚Äôs name does not appear.</p>
<p>Walz did win the Mankato Teachers‚Äô Association‚Äôs Teacher of the Year award ‚Äî a prize given by members of the local teachers‚Äô union ‚Äî in 2002.</p>
<p>In 2003, Walz won an Ethics Award from the Minnesota Academic Excellence Foundation, which comes with a $10,000 prize. But this is not a ‚ÄúTeacher of the Year‚Äù award, nor is it two awards, as the Chadron State College article claimed.</p>
<p>Walz has won two awards related to his teaching, but he did not win any statewide ‚ÄúTeacher of the Year‚Äù awards, as his campaign has led many to believe.</p>
<p>The governor&#8217;s claims about his awards are similar to misleading statements he has made about his military service. He served honorably, but he did not see combat in the Middle East or retire as a command sergeant major, as he has claimed or implied multiple times.</p>
<p>Requests to Walz and the Harris-Walz campaign were not returned prior to press time.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The special episode aired live during day two of the </span><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/topic/democratic-national-convention"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic National Convention</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Chicago, where thousands of protestors gathered to demonstrate.¬†¬†¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pelosi was discussing her new book, ‚ÄúThe Art of Power,‚Äù when a woman started chanting in the back of the audience, per </span><a href="https://deadline.com/2024/08/protesters-nancy-pelosi-stephen-colbert-late-show-video-1236045839/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deadline</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colbert responded by saying, ‚ÄúFor the people at home who can‚Äôt tell, there‚Äôs a protest going on in the audience right now. Hold on young lady, I can hear you. We‚Äôre actually at a commercial break but the subject is on Israel and Palestine, and if you‚Äôll have a seat, we have to go to a commercial break and when we come back I will ask the next question I had on that subject, if you will listen.‚Äù</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The show went to break, and Colbert returned and asked Pelosi about her opinion on ‚Äúthe proper use of American power‚Äù in foreign countries.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúIf the goal is the peaceful and prosperous future for both Israel and Palestinians, what role does the United States play?‚Äù the late-night host asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She began by paraphrasing John F. Kennedy. ‚Äú‚ÄòTo the countries of the world, ask not what America can do for you, but what we can do working together for the freedom of mankind‚Äô and that is our mission,‚Äù Pelosi replied.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She continued, ‚ÄúYes, we‚Äôve had a commitment to Israel, that‚Äôs been in our security interest to do so. Israel was attacked by a terrorist organization. We want the hostages freed, but we don‚Äôt want children killed in Gaza, so we have to come up with a solution.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúWar has no place in a civilized society‚Ä¶ We have to learn more about trust and peace and learning about each other rather than to have a conflict by war,‚Äù Pelosi added.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As some audience members kept yelling, Colbert said, ‚ÄúAs you can see from the continuing protest out here, that answer is unsatisfying to some people.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúIsrael has a right to defend itself ‚Ä¶ But the other part of it that has been so major for all of us for so many years is that there must be a two-state solution.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The yelling continued, which prompted Colbert to address the audience, saying, ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt interrupt my guests.‚Äù</span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>True to form, the Democratic Party‚Äôs 2024 foreign policy platform is as full of historical revisionism as one would predict.</p>
<p>Its contents range from artful dodging to outright untruths. Most importantly, the platform is divorced from the actual Biden-Harris foreign policy record of the last four years.</p>
<p>The most blatant omissions are on Afghanistan, found in a section absurdly titled ‚ÄúLeading with Diplomacy and American Values.‚Äù The platform gives a single cursory mention to the withdrawal, stating that the White House ‚Äúended America‚Äôs longest war‚Äù and led the ‚Äúlargest resettlement effort since the Vietnam War.‚Äù That‚Äôs certainly one way to describe a humiliating retreat that left Americans trapped behind enemy lines, killed 13 military heroes, ignored clear intelligence warnings, and unleashed a historic humanitarian disaster. A subsequent section touts the Biden-Harris administration as a ‚Äústrong advocate for the rights and opportunities of women and girls.‚Äù Did they already forget about the millions of women and girls they relegated to Taliban rule?</p>
<p>The platform‚Äôs discussion of Iran is Orwellian, touting the administration‚Äôs &#8220;aggressive diplomacy&#8221; to &#8220;defend against Iran.&#8221; In other words: relentless appeasement, unchecked attacks on troops and diplomats, ransom payments, and billions in sanctions relief for the leading state sponsor of terrorism. No U.S. presidency has done more to enrich and embolden the regime, and it‚Äôs not even close.</p>
<p>Then comes Russia. The platform argues Democrats have successfully helped Kyiv ‚Äúdefend its territory.‚Äù Don&#8217;t they know Russia murdered its way through Ukraine under its watch? We all remember how Biden and Harris set the stage for Putin‚Äôs invasion with the ‚Äúminor incursion‚Äù gaffe, repeated weapons delays, desperate diplomacy, and their refusal to sanction the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.</p>
<p>The Middle East section does its best to be all things to all people, paying rhetorical lip service to Israel while nodding to Palestinian grievances. Most incredibly, the platform touts Democrats‚Äô supposed defense of Israel at the United Nations. Is that what they meant by restoring funding for UNRWA‚Äôs terrorism, legitimizing the anti-Semitic Human Rights Council, and letting anti-Israel resolutions pass in the Security Council?</p>
<p>To no surprise, the platform also avoids a clear stance on deterring the Chinese Communist Party. Instead, it discusses the need to ‚Äúmanage‚Äù our ‚Äúmost consequential strategic competitor,‚Äù avert ‚Äúa costly spiral to conflict,‚Äù and ‚Äúidentify new areas where the United States and China may be able to work together.‚Äù Forget a theory of victory ‚Äî we all know this is a euphemism for accommodation and appeasing the CCP. And to remove any wonder as to whether Democrats view the PRC as America‚Äôs top security threat, the platform also clarifies that ‚Äúthere is nothing more important than addressing the climate crisis.‚Äù</p>
<p>Is it even worth discussing its absurd border claims? The platform outrageously claims the White House took ‚Äúdecisive action to secure our border‚Äù and ‚Äúdecreased illegal border crossings.‚Äù Even progressives know this is a farce. Biden and Kamala willfully abetted illegal immigration and fueled border chaos.</p>
<p>Regarding Latin America, the platform argues the Biden-Harris Administration ‚Äústrengthened ties with key allies across the Hemisphere.‚Äù But their only new friends seem to be Left-wing authoritarians like the FARC (delisted as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the Blinken State Department) and Maduro, who has enjoyed sweeping sanctions relief, freed relatives, and political cover for his sham election.</p>
<p>The platform also boasts of ‚Äúhistoric investments‚Äù in military capacity ‚Äì quite a claim from a White House that sought to cut the Pentagon‚Äôs buying power. The Biden-Harris Administration has made our military budget its smallest since World War II. And lest we forget, Kamala has even acknowledged that she ‚Äúunequivocally agree[s]‚Äù with the goal of reducing the defense budget.</p>
<p>Americans should be outraged at these distortions, which neglect the war and chaos that have spread across nearly every theater under Biden and Harris. Our national security is clearly weaker under their leadership. Americans know we are less safe and that Kamala would only accelerate the foreign policy failures of the Biden presidency.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Axios reporter rushed to the defense of Vice President Kamala Harris&#8217; heavily criticized proposal to control grocery prices on Tuesday, but her article was hit by a community note on X that provided some important context.</p>
<p>Axios Markets Correspondent Emily Peck wrote, &#8220;One of Kamala Harris&#8217; most controversial policy proposals is a ban on grocery price gouging ‚Äî critics are conflating the idea with Soviet-style price controls, and calling the plan &#8216;Kamunism.'&#8221; Peck added, &#8220;If banning price gouging is communist, then the U.S. went Marxist long ago. Most of us live in states that already have bans in place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Axios also posted a link to the article on X with the caption, &#8220;Don‚Äôt call it price controls: How price gouging bans really work.&#8221;</p>
<p>X slapped a community note on Axios&#8217; post, pointing out that the same author <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/05/31/uk-inflation-food-prices" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called</a> it &#8220;price controls&#8221; when the U.K. considered a short-term policy in 2023 to push retailers to agree to standardized prices on certain groceries like milk and bread. In 2022, another Axios writer, Matt Phillips, referred to the G-7&#8217;s pledge to limit how much Russia could profit from oil sales as &#8220;price controls.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Harris promised last week that her administration would punish companies for &#8220;price-gouging&#8221; as food prices have increased due to high inflation rates over the past three years. Bread and ground beef have risen in cost by around 50% since before the pandemic when Donald Trump was in the White House. Dairy products such as milk, cheese, and butter have also jumped more than 30% in price since 2020, according to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/much-grocery-prices-increased-since-140029491.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yahoo Finance</a>. Eggs are up 54%, and cereal has gone up 28% on average across the country.</p>

Buy here for a theater near you.</b></a></p>
<p>Peck argued that a Harris administration would likely attempt to expand on existing state laws that seek to prevent large companies from hiking prices on essential items during emergencies, such as a hurricane. She wrote that Harris has not provided much detail on her plan, which, Peck claimed, has &#8220;led to wild speculation about what the plan could mean.&#8221; The Axios reporter also argued in favor of Harris&#8217; proposal, writing, &#8220;One advantage of a national ban is that the federal government would have more power to go after big global corporations that are hard to pursue at the state level.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trump referred to the Democratic nominee&#8217;s plan as &#8220;communist,&#8221; saying last week that such a proposal would &#8220;have the exact opposite impact and effect and it leads to food shortages, rationing, hunger, dramatically more inflation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even the Left-leaning Washington Post ran an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/08/15/kamala-harris-price-gouging-groceries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">op-ed</a> blasting Harris for the price control plan.</p>
<p><span class="im"><b><a href="http://www.amiracist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.amiracist.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1723831990829000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3t-JaLPfXbCT45cr5z1k7F">WATCH THE TRAILER FOR ‚ÄòAM I RACIST?‚Äô ‚Äî A MATT WALSH COMEDY ON DEI</a></b></span></p>
<p>‚ÄúAt best, this would lead to shortages, black markets and hoarding, among other distortions seen previous times countries tried to limit price growth by fiat,‚Äù Catherine Rampell wrote. ‚Äú(There‚Äôs a reason narrower ‚Äòprice gouging‚Äô laws that exist in some U.S. states are rarely invoked.) At worst, it might accidentally <em>raise</em> prices.‚Äù</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Government figures for job growth over the past year have been significantly revised after being overestimated by more than 800,000 jobs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Wednesday that job growth throughout the 12 months ending in March would be revised downward by 818,000 jobs, a hefty drop that is roughly equivalent to 0.5% of total jobs, according to </span><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/finance-and-economy/3129087/job-growth-set-to-be-revised-down-by-818000-jobs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Examiner</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A downward revision of </span><a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/20/business/wall-street-banks-brace-for-downward-revision-of-1m-fewer-jobs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 501,000</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would be the largest in 15 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The drop knocks the average monthly job growth over those 12 months down from about 242,000 jobs to about 174,000. The revisions are preliminary and part of an annual review process that reconciles and revises monthly data with more reliable but slower-coming records from state governments, according to </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/21/business/economy/us-jobs-economy.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amiracist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amiracist.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1724211156439000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2-L2DitSaIUj5wz8v0bgxx"><b>Tickets for ‚ÄúAm I Racist?‚Äù are on sale NOW! Buy here for a theater near you.</b></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daily Wire host Ben Shapiro said in a post on X that the revision is ‚Äúamazing for two reasons.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, ‚Äú[t]hey&#8217;ve been lying for a year about Biden job creation,‚Äù Shapiro said. Secondly, ‚Äú[t]hey&#8217;re dumping this data just in time to justify a Federal Reserve interest rate decrease for the election.‚Äù</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">This is amazing for two reasons.<br />
1. They&#8217;ve been lying for a year about Biden job creation.<br />
2. They&#8217;re dumping this data just in time to justify a Federal Reserve interest rate decrease for the election. <a href="https://t.co/p5D8aqT7EW">https://t.co/p5D8aqT7EW</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The revised figures will be incorporated into official government data next year after the revisions are finalized.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The revision would bring jobs numbers into line with other economic indicators that have suggested that the strong jobs reports over the past year were at the very least an outlier, if not giving a false impression of the health of the economy, according to the Times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michelle Bowman, a member of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs Board of Governors, </span><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240820a.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a speech on Tuesday that there are ‚Äúrisks that the labor market has not been as strong as the payroll data have been indicating.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reduction in the jobs numbers may be cited by Federal Reserve officials next month if they decide to lower interest rates. A lowered interest rate could become a campaign talking point for Vice President Kamala Harris as she tries to find an economic message that can connect with Americans who are concerned about the health of the economy by a wide majority.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúA large negative revision would indicate that the strength of hiring was already fading before this past April,‚Äù Wells Fargo economists Sarah House and Aubrey Woessner wrote last week, according to the </span><a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/20/business/wall-street-banks-brace-for-downward-revision-of-1m-fewer-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A large revision would make ‚Äúrisks to the full employment side of the Fed‚Äôs dual mandate more salient amid widespread softening in other labor market data.‚Äù</span></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúThe Office of the Vice President is a position that requires the trust of the American people and a solemn commitment to duty on behalf of the United States of America,‚Äù the letter began. ‚ÄúAs veterans who have served our nation, we feel compelled to address your egregious misrepresentations and urge you to come clean to the American people.‚Äù</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúYou have stated that you are ‚Äòdamn proud‚Äô of your service, and like any American veteran, you should be,‚Äù they stated. ‚ÄúBut there is no honor in lying about the nature of your service. Repeatedly claiming to be a ‚ÄòRetired Command Sergeant Major‚Äô when you did not complete the requirements was not honorable. Nor was it honorable to claim to carry weapons ‚Äòin war‚Äô when you had not served in war, and abandoning the men and women under your leadership just as they were getting ready to deploy was certainly not honorable either.‚Äù</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amiracist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amiracist.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1724211156439000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2-L2DitSaIUj5wz8v0bgxx"><b>Tickets for ‚ÄúAm I Racist?‚Äù are on sale NOW! Buy here for a theater near you.</b></a></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúTo be blunt, when you falsely claim military service that did not happen and abandon your post, you diminish the real sacrifices made by veterans who did serve in combat,‚Äù they charged. ‚ÄúMilitary service is not merely a job or a uniform. Those who serve in the Armed Forces endure rigorous training, face perilous situations, and make sacrifices that most civilians can‚Äôt comprehend. The honor of wearing the uniform is earned through dedication, bravery, and an unwavering sense of duty. You have displayed none of these characteristics as you have lied your way through a political career launched on the foundation of a title you did not earn and combat deployments you did not take part in.‚Äù</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúIn short, our grave concern stems from the fact that the office of the Vice President is one heartbeat away from becoming the Commander-In-Chief. You‚Äôve already demonstrated your unwillingness to lead in time of war and a lack of honor through your blatant misrepresentations exploiting and co-opting the experiences of America‚Äôs combat veterans for personal gain,‚Äù they declared.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúAs a result, America‚Äôs veterans and servicemembers are rightfully concerned about what would happen to them should you ascend to the Presidency. When America asked you to lead your troops into War, you turned your back on your troops. You have violated the trust of our brothers and sisters in arms. Their blood, sweat, and sacrifice are the only reason our nation is able to exist. Until you admit you lied to them, there is no way you can be trusted to serve as Vice President.‚Äù they concluded.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Norman Rockwell would roll over in his grave if he learned what passes for freedom in the Democratic Party, seen in the Presidential ticket of Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. Rockwell painted four scenes </span><a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/norman-rockwells-four-freedoms-brought-ideals-america-life-180968033/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the midst of World War II</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that captured the longing of the nation </span><a href="https://www.mfah.org/blogs/inside-mfah/norman-rockwells-four-freedoms" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">for foundational freedoms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Worship, Freedom from Want, and Freedom from Fear. However, Harris and Walz offer a dystopian view that empowers government, not ordinary citizens. Those freedoms are replaced with one, new category: </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/29/kamala-harris-abortion-restoring-roe-00171657" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚Äúfreedom‚Äù for unlimited abortion.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider the violations of basic freedoms from both Harris and Walz, when in power.</span></p>
<p><b>On Freedom of Speech: </b>Attorney Jonathan Turley <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/4820490-harris-walz-administration-free-speech/">notes</a>:¬†<span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúIn her failed 2020 presidential bid, Harris </span><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/442261-harris-says-her-administration-would-hold-social-media-platforms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ran on censorship</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,‚Äù something he both </span><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/3115414/harris-walz-threat-to-first-amendment/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">practiced and preached</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As California‚Äôs Attorney General, Harris didn‚Äôt support the rights of citizen journalist David Daleiden, exposing </span><a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/02/us-news/kamala-harris-accused-of-weaponizing-calif-ags-office-against-activist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">her campaign donor, Planned Parenthood</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/08/us-news/undercover-video-allegedly-shows-planned-parenthood-scandal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">and used</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†the power of her office to raid his apartment, suppressing information about the alleged trafficking in human remains harvested from late-term abortions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately after taking office, the Biden-Harris Administration </span><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/wall-street-journal-hammers-supreme-court-giving-biden-administration-license-social-media-censorship" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pressured</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> social media companies to block those who disagreed with their handling of the COVID pandemic, allegedly taking </span><a href="https://nypost.com/2023/09/08/biden-officials-likely-violated-first-amendment-over-covid-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">direct steps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against opponents. A recent lawsuit notes accusations that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Department of Justice (DOJ) engaged in </span><a href="https://aflegal.org/america-first-legal-lawsuit-exposes-the-fbi-implemented-extensive-nationwide-social-media-monitoring-ahead-of-the-2022-midterms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚Äúextensive‚Äù monitoring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of citizens during the 2022 election season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She‚Äôs found a kindred spirit in Walz, who </span><a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2024/08/16/whos_for_the_first_amendment_--_and_whos_against_151458.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told MSNBC in 2022, </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There&#8217;s no guarantee to free speech on misinformation or hate speech, and especially around our democracy.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That‚Äôs not exactly his story in stump speeches. Recently Walz said the &#8220;golden rule&#8221; in America is to </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/08/07/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-and-governor-tim-walz-at-a-campaign-event-eau-clarie-wi/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚Äúmind your own damn business.‚Äù</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Yet, during COVID he set up a snitch line, so that neighbors could inform on neighbors who didn‚Äôt tow his line. Harris and Walz abuse of weaponized governmental agencies signals trouble ahead.</span></p>
<p><b>On Freedom of Worship</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2020/09/22/catholic-abortion-vote-biden-trump-ruth-bader-ginsburg-2020-column/5853831002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris was so offended</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by a faithful Catholic up for a job as judge, that she said </span><a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/kamala-harriss-anti-catholic-bigotry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in a Senate hearing</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that his involvement in a Catholic charity disqualified him to serve. Repeatedly, </span><a href="https://firstliberty.org/news/kamala-harris-supported-legislation-that-threatened-religious-freedom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">she sponsored legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that gutted the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Religious Freedom Restoration Act </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(RFRA), which protects people of faith from being forced to act against their conscience rights. As lead sponsor of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do No Harm Act</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the benignly named </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equality Act</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Harris targeted Americans with faith if they did not comply with her social engineering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And consider her </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/05/11/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-after-the-senate-vote-on-the-womens-health-protection-act/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">passion project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women‚Äôs Health Protection Act</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (WHPA) that goes radically far beyond </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roe v. Wade</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a letter to U.S. Representatives, the U.S. Council of Catholic Bishops </span><a href="https://www.usccb.org/resources/WHPA%20opposition%20letter%20House%20and%20fact%20sheet%20July%202022%20clean.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">noted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: ‚ÄúWHPA plainly seeks to force religious health professionals and religious hospitals to perform abortions against their beliefs. If it did not, there would be no reasons for the WHPA to specifically state that it overrides the longstanding, bipartisan ‚Ä¶ RFRA‚Äì something no bill passed by Congress has ever done.‚Äù And the measure blocks states‚Äô rights as well.</span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA), who is running for re-election against the GOP‚Äôs Dave McCormick, accepted a $5,000 donation from a group pushing for more EB-5 visas, which have been used by Chinese nationals to enter the U.S. in high numbers.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Federal Election Commission¬†<a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?202407159660947686" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filings show</a> that the Immigrant Investors Association/Invest in the USA PAC donated to Casey in June. Casey is the only Senate candidate to have accepted a donation from the group, the New York Post <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/19/us-news/pennsylvania-dem-sen-bob-casey-backed-by-group-helping-chinese-nationals-obtain-us-residency-citizenship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúThe overhauled EB-5 program, which requires a minimum investment of $800,000 for certain projects, has drawn the attention of Chinese nationals,‚Äù The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-investors-warm-to-sweetened-u-s-cash-for-visa-program-c23fdaed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a> in August 2023, adding, ‚ÄúIn May, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis¬†signed a series of bills banning Chinese nationals from buying land in the state unless they are U.S. permanent residents.‚Äù</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúMainland Chinese nationals scored 6,125 out of the total 10,855 in fiscal year 2022,‚Äù The Post pointed out, adding that &#8220;Chinese citizens have historically constituted the largest nationality of those seeking visas through the EB-5 program.&#8221;</p>

<p>‚ÄúCasey was at a June fundraiser hosted by one IIUSA PAC lobbyist and attended by another,&#8221; the Post reported. ‚ÄúBoth of the lobbyists, Commonwealth managing partners Keith Pemrick and George McElwee, have been involved extensively <a href="https://iiusa.org/blog/eb-5-leaders-advocacy-summit-starts-tomorrow/">with EB-5 issues</a>.‚Äù</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Casey‚Äôs cynicism regarding immigration has been in evidence for years. ‚ÄúSince taking office in 2006, Casey has voted several times against border security measures during years he was not running for re-election while calling for stronger border security in years when his name was on the ballot,‚Äù Fox News <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dem-sen-bob-casey-slammed-by-gop-for-shifting-immigration-stances-complicit-in-the-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">For example, in 2024, Casey¬†<a href="https://www.mychesco.com/a/news/national/u-s-senators-take-aim-at-fentanyl-crisis-with-new-bill-to-bolster-southwest-border-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced legislation</a> ‚Äúaimed at fortifying security along the southwest border.‚Äù But in 2021 and 2022, when he was not up for re-election, he voted twice in opposition to drug detection at the border. In 2006, running against the GOP‚Äôs Rick Santorum, he claimed he was against amnesty for illegal immigrants. Yet in 2007 and 2013, when he was not running for re-election, he favored legislation that led to a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúNow that Bob Casey¬†is in the race of his life, he‚Äôs hoping Pennsylvanians will forget he opposed building a border wall and even supported mass amnesty and taxpayer-funded health care for illegal immigrants,‚Äù National Republican Senatorial Committee spokesperson Phillip Letsou said. ‚ÄúCasey will say anything for power, even if that means lying to Pennsylvanians.‚Äù</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest speaker of the night was billed to be President Joe Biden, but his farewell address to the delegates didn‚Äôt happen until very late on the East Coast after earlier speeches went longer than the convention officials expected.</span></p>

      <title>DHS Made No Effort To Locate Missing ‚ÄòUnaccompanied Alien Children,‚Äô Auditor Says In ‚ÄòUrgent‚Äô Alert</title>
      <link>https://www.dailywire.com/news/dhs-made-no-effort-to-locate-missing-unaccompanied-alien-children-auditor-says-in-urgent-alert</link>

      <description>HHS loses track of 33% of unaccompanied minors within 30 days of them being delivered to &amp;#8220;sponsors,&amp;#8221; raising fears of human trafficking or abuse. The attempt to serve a Notice to Appear to children at their sponsor‚Äôs address would serve as another government check-in‚Äìbut it has not been made.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Department of Homeland Security does not know the location of nearly 300,000 unaccompanied children who came to the country illegally and were sent to live with adult sponsors, the department&#8217;s inspector general said in an alert flagging the ‚Äúurgent issue‚Äù for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúICE must take immediate action to ensure the safety of UCs residing in the United States,‚Äù the inspector general <a href="https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2024-08/OIG-24-46-Aug24.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>¬†in the report, released Monday. ‚ÄúWithout an ability to monitor the location and status of UCs, ICE has no assurance UCs are safe from trafficking, exploitation, or forced labor.‚Äù</p>
<p>The report is a significant blow to Vice President Kamala Harris, coming as she and other members of her party tout their &#8220;compassionate&#8221; border policies at the Democratic National Convention. Another relocation program for illegal immigrants ‚Äî hailed in the DNC <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/dnc-platform-endorses-radical-plan-to-grant-citizenship-to-illegal-immigrants" target="_blank" rel="noopener">platform</a> as a significant achievement of the Biden-Harris administration ‚Äî was <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/dnc-platform-endorses-radical-plan-to-grant-citizenship-to-illegal-immigrants" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shuttered</a> after auditors documented massive fraud by sponsors.</p>
<p>ICE transferred 448,820 unaccompanied alien children to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) between fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2023. After dipping from 68,000 to 15,000 transfers between 2019 and 2020, the annual number of transfers has¬†hovered around 120,000 annually since.</p>
<p>Though ICE is tasked with keeping tabs on unaccompanied children and serving them with a ‚Äúnotice to appear‚Äù as part of their immigration case, the agency largely failed to do so. ICE failed to locate around 291,000 children handed over to HHS, some two-thirds of transfers.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAt one location we visited, 34,823 (84 percent) of 41,638 UCs in the local area had not been served NTAs,‚Äù the inspector general wrote.</p>
<p>Thirty-two thousand minors who were given a &#8220;notice to appear&#8221; did not show up to their court dates.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat number may have been much larger had ICE issued NTAs to the more than 291,000 UCs who were not placed into removal proceedings,‚Äù the inspector general said.</p>
<p>There is reason to believe that many of the no-shows are missing or dead, or have been kidnapped or trafficked. After ICE turns children over to HHS, the latter agency relies on contractors to place the minors in care of adult illegal immigrant ‚Äúsponsors,&#8221; many of whom claim to be relatives. The Biden administration has loosened the vetting and restrictions on these sponsors in an attempt to deal with the massive number of children crossing the border.</p>
<p>Whistleblowers from DHS, HHS, and holding camp and transportation contractors say that children are often trafficked across the border, placed with sponsors who are part of that trafficking network, and <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/guatemalan-traffickers-exploit-bidens-unaccompanied-alien-children-program-records-suggest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forced to work in sex or labor slavery</a> to pay off a debt to the cartel. Documents show that HHS sent children to live with known gang members, and turned minors over to adults at airports even when their IDs suggested they were not the vetted sponsor.</p>
<p>ICE personnel interviewed by the inspector general said they, too, had encountered exploited children.</p>
<p>Agents ‚Äúhad identified UCs in unsafe conditions but were unable to intervene,&#8221; the report states. &#8220;One ICE officer expressed concern with not being able to take action in a case involving a UC whose sponsor claimed the UC was in an inappropriate relationship with her husband,‚Äù the report said.</p>
<p>That agent did not receive assistance from his superiors, however ‚Äî a common state of affairs. Nine out of 10 ICE offices made no effort to locate missing unaccompanied minors, the inspector general&#8217;s report found. ICE is not alone in its failure to keep tabs on unaccompanied minors, the inspector general says.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDOJ, HHS, and DHS [legal] and ERO [Enforcement and Removal Operations] agreed to coordinate when a UC fails to appear for court, however this agreement and related process has not been documented in a formal policy or guidance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite ‚Äúnew guidance to verify the location of UCs who failed to appear for their court hearings and improve coordination with HHS, we found ICE often neither followed this guidance nor issued corresponding guidance for its officers,‚Äù the report says. ‚ÄúWe met with ERO personnel at 10 field offices, including some virtually. Officers at only one location stated they attempted to locate UCs who did not appear in immigration court,‚Äù the report said.</p>
<p>Nor did ICE have a system to alert HHS.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen ICE does not share information with HHS regarding UCs who did not appear for hearings, HHS personnel are unable to determine if UCs need wellness checks or post-release services for individuals at an increased risk of being trafficked,‚Äù the report states.</p>
<p>HHS attempts to place a call to sponsors ‚Äî its sole follow-up effort ‚Äî to check in on unaccompanied minors 30 days after handing them off. Most of the time, sponsors are noncooperative or tell HHS representatives that the child is no longer in their custody, and that they are unaware of the minor&#8217;s whereabouts.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOverall, the agency lost immediate contact with a third of migrant children,‚Äù The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/25/us/unaccompanied-migrant-child-workers-exploitation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Times</a> reported in February 2023, saying 85,000 children were missing.</p>
<p>Applying that rate to a more recent estimate of unaccompanied minors suggests there may be¬†150,000 <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/whistleblowers-detail-how-85000-unaccompanied-minors-went-missing-after-biden-admin-dropped-them-off-with-sponsors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">missing children</a>.</p>
<p>HHS claims it is no longer responsible for migrant children after they enter the care of sponsors. The agency declines to cooperate with Child Protective Services and local school districts that attempt to check in on missing children. That means that, unlike every other child in the country, there is almost no way for anyone to know where unaccompanied minor children are ‚Äî or whether they are safe or alive.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rogan agreed, saying, ‚ÄúYeah, it doesn&#8217;t feel healthy for me either.‚Äù</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the thing with America, right?‚Äù the actor explained. ‚Äú</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You&#8217;ve got to remember that it is the beacon of freedom for everybody in the world.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s a huge responsibility,&#8221; he added. &#8220;If people are looking for something to change in their life or something positive, the vast majority of people will look towards America and say, ‚Äòwell, that&#8217;s the beacon.

      <description>Former CNN host Don Lemon shared a video on social media Wednesday showing women he interviewed on the street who revealed who they were going to vote for in the upcoming election.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former CNN host Don Lemon shared a video on social media Wednesday showing women he interviewed on the street who revealed who they were going to vote for in the upcoming election.</p>
<p>The left-wing journalist interviewed white and black women on the streets of Chicago and all of the women who he included in the video said that they were voting for Trump.</p>
<p>The first woman that Lemon interviewed said: &#8220;I&#8217;m going for Trump. I feel like every time they don&#8217;t want somebody who is good for us to win, they throw somebody black in our face, thinking that&#8217;s gonna, like, make us vote for the black person.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going for Trump,&#8221; she later added. &#8220;Kamala was on Biden&#8217;s team, and I don&#8217;t like Biden. Gas wasn&#8217;t this high when Trump was our president. Food wasn&#8217;t this high. I&#8217;m going for Trump.&#8221;</p>

Buy here for a theater near you.</b></a></p>
<p>The next woman said that she voted for Obama because he was black and that she did not want to vote for Harris &#8220;because she&#8217;s the first black woman to run for president or to win.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m supporting Trump,&#8221; the woman said. &#8220;Because it has to change. It has to change, and now I vote more for what fits me better as a person, rather than voting for the black person or voting for the first woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another woman said that she was voting for Trump because &#8220;we had good times with Donald Trump.&#8221;</p>
<p>When asked what she thought about Harris, the woman said: &#8220;I don&#8217;t like her, the way she speaks, the giddiness, the laughing, everything&#8217;s a joke, and it&#8217;s not a joke. We&#8217;re in trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>A fifth woman told Lemon that she, too, was voting for Trump because she has &#8220;always been a fan of his.&#8221;</p>

<p>When asked about Harris, the woman said: &#8220;She&#8217;s phony and fake. You know what I&#8217;m saying? &#8230; I&#8217;m not feeling her.&#8221;</p>
<p>A sixth woman from Virginia told Lemon that she used to be against Trump until she moved to Ohio and &#8220;saw the other side&#8221; of his policies, presumably because she moved from a blue state to a red state.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former President Barack Obama paid tribute to his former vice president and current President Joe Biden on Tuesday night, saying in his address at the Democratic National Convention that Biden exited the 2024 race &#8220;for the sake of the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obama, who just a month ago reportedly pushed for Biden to end his campaign, said during his <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/21/politics/video/barack-obama-biden-dnc-chicago-digvid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speech</a> that the president &#8220;was selfless enough to do the rarest thing there is in politics&#8221; when Biden announced on July 21 that he was stepping aside and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris to be the Democrats&#8217; nominee.</p>
<p>&#8220;At a time when the other party had turned into a cult of personality, we needed a leader who was steady and brought people together,&#8221; Obama said, referring to Biden. &#8220;And was selfless enough to do the rarest thing there is in politics, putting his own ambition aside for the sake of the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;History will remember Joe Biden as an outstanding president who defended democracy at a moment of great danger,&#8221; Obama added. &#8220;And I am proud to call him my president, but I am even prouder to call him my friend.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amiracist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amiracist.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1724211156439000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2-L2DitSaIUj5wz8v0bgxx"><b>Tickets for ‚ÄúAm I Racist?‚Äù are on sale NOW! Buy here for a theater near you.</b></a></p>
<p>Obama also praised the Biden-Harris administration&#8217;s handling of the economy and the COVID pandemic. Biden was in California while Obama spoke at the DNC in Chicago. The 81-year-old president and first lady Jill Biden boarded a plane for a West Coast vacation shortly after Biden gave his keynote address at the DNC late Monday night.</p>
<p>Just days before Biden announced he was dropping out, the Associated Press <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-democrats-drop-out-election-2024-3f9e3d15431fd4974771a54e1d0e4ea7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Obama and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) were expressing concerns to Democratic allies about Biden continuing to run for re-election following his disastrous June 27 debate against former President Donald Trump. The AP cited &#8220;information from almost a dozen people&#8221; who discussed Obama&#8217;s role in urging Biden to leave the race. The Washington Post also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/18/obama-says-biden-must-consider-viability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Obama was telling his allies, including Pelosi, that he was concerned about Biden&#8217;s path to victory.</p>
<p>In an early morning post nearly a week after Biden dropped out and endorsed Harris, Obama also got behind the Harris campaign, <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/obama-endorses-kamala-harris-in-an-overnight-post-on-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writing</a>, ‚ÄúEarlier this week, Michelle and I called our friend Kamala Harris. We told her we think she‚Äôll make a fantastic President of the United States, and that she has our full support. At this critical moment for our country, we‚Äôre going to do everything we can to make sure she wins in November. We hope you‚Äôll join us.‚Äù</p>

<p>On Monday, Pelosi declined to confirm or deny if she had spoken with Biden after reportedly pushing for him to end his campaign.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes you have to take a punch for the children. I did what I had to do,&#8221; she said. &#8220;My concern was not about the president, it was about his campaign.&#8221;</p>
<p>CNN&#8217;s Chris Wallace <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/chris-wallace-eviscerates-dncs-attempt-to-show-love-to-biden-he-got-thrown-out-of-a-window" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blasted</a> Democrats at the DNC for attempting to pay homage to Biden.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs going to be a lot of talk tonight about how generous it was of him and and selfless of him. He was basically forced out by Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries,‚Äù Wallace said on Monday. ‚ÄúAnd I suspect even the fact that there has been this surge of enthusiasm since he left and Kamala Harris took his place ‚Äî that‚Äôs got to be pretty tough, too. You got thrown out of a window, and everybody‚Äôs applauding the person who‚Äôs now in the room.‚Äù</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said this week that he is open to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. serving in his administration if he were to win a second term this fall.</p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s remarks come after Kennedy <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/rfk-jr-after-calling-biden-harris-a-threat-to-democracy-asks-kamala-for-cabinet-position">reportedly</a> said he reached out to Democrat presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris&#8217; &#8220;highest intermediaries,&#8221; who said her team had &#8220;no interest in talking.&#8221; Kennedy¬†wanted to talk about dropping out of the race and endorsing her campaign in exchange for her giving him a cabinet position. Kennedy <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/rfk-jr-lashes-out-at-kamala-after-her-campaign-spurns-his-attempt-to-secure-cabinet-position">lashed out</a> after being rejected and attacked Harris and the Democrat Party.</p>
<p>During a subsequent interview, Trump <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/20/politics/trump-consider-appointing-rfk-jr-administration-role/index.html">told CNN</a> he likes and respects RFK Jr.</p>

<p>&#8220;He‚Äôs a brilliant guy. He‚Äôs a very smart guy. I‚Äôve known him for a very long time,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know he was thinking about getting out, but if he is thinking about getting out, certainly I‚Äôd be open to it.‚Äù</p>
<p>Trump said that he would &#8220;love&#8221; an endorsement from Kennedy because he&#8217;s &#8220;always liked&#8221; him.</p>
<p>He indicated that he &#8220;probably would&#8221; appoint Kennedy to a role in the administration if Kennedy were to drop out and endorse him.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI like him a lot. I respect him a lot,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúI probably would, if something like that would happen. He‚Äôs a very different kind of a guy ‚Äî a very smart guy. And, yeah, I would be honored by that endorsement, certainly.‚Äù</p>
<p>While Kennedy is a lifelong Democrat, he has attacked the party harder than he has the Republican Party over the course of the election.</p>

<p>RFK Jr. continued those attacks on Tuesday when he called out the party for trying to rebrand itself as the &#8220;party of liberty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kamala Harris says that Americans should make personal decisions without the &#8216;government telling them what to do.&#8217; Tim Walz‚Äôs Golden Rule is &#8216;Mind your own damn business,'&#8221; he posted on X. &#8220;In view of the censorship, surveillance, vaccine mandates, and the confederacy of fixers openly working to prevent me from getting on ballots, this is like the arsonist telling us he‚Äôs a firefighter.&#8221;</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/topic/donald-trump-jr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump Jr.</a> pinned responsibility for the assassination attempt on his father last month on the years of hatred that the mainstream media has directed at him.</p>
<p>Trump Jr. made the remarks during an exclusive interview with The Daily Wire during live coverage of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) on Tuesday when asked about the media&#8217;s honeymoon period with Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>He said that he believes that those in the media ‚Äî whom he described earlier as &#8220;regime propagandists&#8221; ‚Äî are going to do whatever they can to continue helping Harris avoid accountability for as long as possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s been the presumptive nominee for basically a month, she has yet to answer any actual questions,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think the only interview I saw her doing was with her communist running mate, Tim Walz, where they interviewed themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But she&#8217;s not taken really any questions from the press,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Anything she&#8217;s done has been scripted on a teleprompter, and no one in the media even cares. No one&#8217;s even saying, &#8216;Hey, should we maybe actually hear from what will be the actual nominee, but certainly the presumptive nominee?&#8217; And I guess they&#8217;re fine just running the same playbook, which is, you know, let&#8217;s hide her in the basement. We know she&#8217;s not good off-script. She&#8217;s not even that good on script, but the more we can keep her from real people, the more we can keep her, you know, on-script and not impromptu, the better it is for us to be able to perpetuate the lie and install the candidate of their choice.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amiracist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amiracist.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1723831707612000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0pyrv88A5nsmWM2F2Wr9As"><b>Tickets for ‚ÄúAm I Racist?‚Äù are on sale NOW! Buy here for a theater near you.</b></a></p>
<p>He called the media &#8220;truly embarrassing&#8221; and a &#8220;disgrace&#8221; to the country and hypocritical for calling Republicans a threat to democracy while not holding Harris accountable over her record.</p>
<p>&#8220;They seem to be able to run roughshod over all of those things, but again, that&#8217;s nothing new,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They called everyone in the world a fascist, and yet, they&#8217;re the ones that want to jail their political opposition. They&#8217;re the ones that want to censor and silence them. They are the ones that, you know, ultimately caused an assassination attempt of the leading candidate of the opposition party.&#8221;</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utah Senator <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/topic/mike-lee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mike Lee</a> (R) ripped into the Biden-Harris administration on Tuesday over the prosecution and conviction of 89-year-old pro-life activist Eva Edl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lee was <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/breaking-89-year-old-woman-convicted-faces-over-a-decade-in-prison-for-peaceful-pro-life-protest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reacting to the news</a> that Edl and six other pro-life activists were convicted in federal court in Detroit late Tuesday morning of charges brought against them by the Biden administration accusing them of conspiracy against rights and violating the FACE Act. They could now be sentenced to over a decade in prison and hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines upon sentencing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edl, a devout Christian, was rounded up as a child and forced into a concentration camp by the forces of Yugoslavian communist dictator Josip Broz Tito in the aftermath of World War II. She later immigrated to the United States and became very active in pro-life activism across the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúKamala Harris and Joe Biden are sending an elderly survivor of communist prison camps back to prison using the FACE Act against pro-lifers,‚Äù Lee posted on X. ‚ÄúEvil.‚Äù</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lee has repeatedly pointed out the disproportionate use of the FACE Act against pro-lifers and has introduced legislation multiple times in the Senate to repeal the Clinton-era law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fellow Republican Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX) has also pushed for the repeal of the FACE Act and reacted on Tuesday to the verdict out of Detroit.</span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other pro-lifers convicted on Tuesday include Chester Gallagher, Heather Idoni, </span><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/pro-life-father-facing-11-years-in-prison-says-biden-doj-is-targeting-conservative-christians"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joel Curry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Justin Phillips, Cal Zastrow, and his daughter Eva Zastrow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The charges stemmed from a peaceful demonstration, which the defendants called a ‚ÄúRescue,‚Äù where the group sat and stood outside of the Northland Family Planning Clinic in Sterling Heights, Michigan, alongside a group of other pro-life activists. Edl and Idoni were convicted on an additional charge for a pro-life protest they attended at the Women‚Äôs Health Clinic in Saginaw, Michigan.</span></p>
<p>Each of the defendants pointed to their faith in Jesus as what motivated them to go to Northland to try persuade women from getting abortions.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concluding arguments were made on Monday before the case was handed to the jury, which started deliberating Tuesday morning at 8:30 a.m. local time. The jury, composed of seven women and five men, took around 3.5 hours to find them all guilty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sentencing date has not yet been set as the lawyers have an opportunity to make briefings to Judge Matthew Leitman, who oversaw the case, to dismiss it. </span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/topic/msnbc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MSNBC</a> contributor said at the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday that Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris may replace former President Barack Obama as the most influential black politician in the party.</p>
<p>Commentator April Ryan made the remark when she was asked during a segment on the network about the &#8220;star power&#8221; of having Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama speak on Harris&#8217; behalf tonight at the convention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, first of all, Michelle Obama is stratospheric. She is an icon. She is authentic,&#8221; Ryan said. &#8220;When you talk about someone reaching someone, she is Chicago, born and bred, South Side. You can&#8217;t get more authentic than that. When she speaks, she speaks to the heart. So let&#8217;s go there, and people believe her and feel her. But when you have two people ‚Äî beyond Reverend Al Sharpton, who I&#8217;m sitting right next to ‚Äî who are some of the greatest orators of our time, you know, people are going to listen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This moment is even larger than when Barack Obama became president,&#8221; she claimed. &#8220;I remember the night that he was elected, and I happened to be at the White House &#8230; and I&#8217;ll never forget all the kids who ran to the White House and just a spontaneous crowd, because they saw change. They saw people who are authentic and look like them.&#8221;</p>
<p>After continuing to gush about Michelle Obama for another several moments, Ryan commented about the former president.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then with her husband, I mean, I joke about this, but there&#8217;s Jesus, HBCUs, and then there&#8217;s Barack Obama,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It may change, it may change a little bit if Kamala Harris becomes president. But you know, these are two people people want to hear from, especially right now, as we&#8217;ve heard so much about this tension, if you will, these conversations about how to save the democracy that ultimately led to President Biden saying, I&#8217;m going to step aside for the sake of the democracy to make sure that we can keep the Republic.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a Tuesday post on </span><a href="https://x.com/buttkicker7/status/1825984862458613990"><span style="font-weight: 400;">X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Chiefs star shared a clip from the first night of the 2024 DNC in Chicago with </span><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/catholic-theologians-clergymen-accuse-pope-francis-paul-bois"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roman Catholic Cardinal Blase Cupich</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the podium giving the opening prayer and the religious leader‚Äôs </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pectoral cross could not be seen because it was tucked inside the Cardinal&#8217;s jacket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúAmerica needs more Jesus not less,‚Äù Butker‚Äôs post read. ‚ÄúWe need our shepherds to fearlessly lead and not be afraid to proclaim that Christ is King.‚Äù</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Butker noted, the Cardinal faced additional criticism because during his invocation, the name Jesus was not mentioned once, as </span><a href="https://www.lifenews.com/2024/08/20/opening-prayer-at-democrat-convention-didnt-even-mention-jesus/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LifeNews</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> noted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During this prayer, the religious leader called on the faithful ‚Äúto root out ongoing injustices in our national life, especially those created by moral blindness and fear of the other‚Äù and to forge a ‚Äúnew chapter of our nation‚Äôs history.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At one point, the Cardinal of the Archdiocese of Chicago also quoted Pope Francis, but not Jesus.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúHiding his pectoral cross, and never once [m]entioning the name of Jesus, Cdl.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another person wrote, ‚ÄúDid the catholic priest notice the horrific child sacrifice abortion ritual happening outside the DNC convention or is he just going to ignore that?‚Äù</span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/topic/hollywood" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hollywood</a> power couple Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez are headed for divorce after two years of marriage, the second time the two were in a relationship.</p>
<p>Lopez filed for the divorce herself on Tuesday in L.A. and did not use an attorney, TMZ <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/08/20/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-file-divorce/?adid=social-tw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>. She listed the date of separation as April 26, 2024.</p>
<p>According to the report, Lopez choosing to file the divorce on August 20 potentially carried some significance because they held a large wedding ceremony in Georgia exactly two years ago for their family and friends.</p>
<p>TMZ said that there did not appear to be any kind of a prenup agreement in place and that money issues between the two have not yet been settled.</p>
<p>The report added that she decided to be the one to file for divorce despite not having everything settled in terms of who gets what because there of &#8220;PR concerns.&#8221;</p>
<p>TMZ <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/06/08/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-sell-marital-home-beverly-hills-divorce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> earlier this summer that the two were quietly selling the mansion they bought together in Beverly Hills after they got married.</p>
<p>Affleck and Lopez first <a href="https://www.sheknows.com/entertainment/articles/2526116/ben-affleck-jennifer-lopez-how-they-met-gigli/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">met</a> in early 2002 on the set of the crime comedy &#8220;Gigli&#8221; while Lopez was married to Cris Judd.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amiracist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amiracist.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1723831707612000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0pyrv88A5nsmWM2F2Wr9As"><b>Tickets for ‚ÄúAm I Racist?‚Äù are on sale NOW! Buy here for a theater near you.</b></a></p>
<p>In July 2002, Affleck and Lopez were spotted kissing at her birthday party. Two days later, she <a href="https://ew.com/article/2002/07/26/j-lo-files-divorce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed</a> for a divorce from Judd.</p>
<p>By November of that year, the two were engaged and set to be married the following year. However, just one day before their wedding in September 2003, they decided to push back the wedding date, <a href="https://people.com/celebrity/lopez-affleck-postpone-weekend-wedding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">citing</a> &#8220;excessive media attention.&#8221;</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen we found ourselves seriously contemplating hiring three separate ‚Äòdecoy brides‚Äô at three different locations, we realized that something was awry,&#8221; they said at the time. ‚ÄúWe began to feel that the spirit of what should have been the happiest day of our lives could be compromised. We felt what should have been a joyful and sacred day could be spoiled for us, our families and our friends.‚Äù</p>
<p>By January 2004, they decided to call off the wedding and the two went their separate ways for the next 17 years until they rekindled their relationship in early 2021 following a series of failed relationships that each had dealt with in recent years.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The initial hearing to drop Shiloh‚Äôs surname was scheduled for July, but that was postponed due to a problem with the background check, the outlet noted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Unfortunately, the court was unable to complete the background check ahead of today&#8217;s hearing, so the hearing was rescheduled for August 19,&#8221; Shiloh‚Äôs lawyer Peter Levine said at the time in a statement obtained by PEOPLE.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúEveryone undergoing a name-change request needs to have a background check conducted by the court clerk, and because of clerical error, Shiloh&#8217;s hearing has been continued to a new date,‚Äù Levine added.</span></p>
